:::

Welcome to Experimentology. This is a book about how to do psychology experiments! Much of what we cover in the book is about the nitty gritty of how to design your study, how to analyze your data, or even how to name your files! But before we can get into all that, we're going to need to have a conversation about what an experiment is. And that in turn will lead us pretty quickly to talk about **causality**, since the unique contribution of experiments is to help us measure causal effects.

The guiding mantra of this book is that experiments are for estimating causal effects. and that good experiments do so in a maximally precise and unbiased way, leading to strong generalizations. Much of our advice about how to navigate decision-making with respect to measurement, design, and sampling comes directly from this mantra. 

The second part of this chapter is about theory building. Sometimes you just want to see what happens, like a kid knocking down a tower. And sometimes you want to know the answer to a specific applied question, like "will giving a midterm vs. weekly quizzes lead students in a class to perform better on the final." But more often, our goal is to create psychological theories that help us explain and predict new observations. These theories are contentful hypotheses about causal structures and how they relate to observed effects.

Having discussed experiments and theories, we will then be in a position to talk a bit about what features an experiment will to contribute to theory, our last topic. But, as we'll do in most chapters in the book, we'll begin with a concrete example.

🔬 Case study: Generalization and similarity

<!-- Let's play a number game. Imagine I give you the number 16, and ask you how similar other numbers are to that one. You'll probably agree that 32 is more similar than 33. Is 96 more similar than 94? How about 6 vs. 8? Perhaps surprisingly, people's judgments on such problems are quite systematic [@tenenbaum2000]: the more "features" that two numbers share, the more similar they are judged to be. Not only is 32 even like 16, it's also a power of 2, and divisible by 8; in contrast, 33 shares none of these features.  -->

<!-- Predicting arbitrary similarity is one of the hardest problems of psychology, and is likened to one of the biggest challenges for organisms: generalization.  -->

How do you take what you know and apply it to a new situation? One answer is that you use the same answer that has worked in similar situations -- but to do this kind of extrapolation, you need a notion of similarity. Early learning theorists were obsessed with these issues of similarity and generalization because their view was that organisms (humans being no exception) learned conditioned associations with specific stimuli and then generalized from these associations to determine their response to new situations. So an animal conditioned to salivate to a tone of a particular frequency might salivate slightly less to a tone that was close in pitch, and salivate substantially less or not at all to a tone that was further away. 

Roger Shepard worked for much of his career on understanding this problem of similarity and generalization, culminating in what he called the "universal law of generalization," which allowed generalizations to be derived in a wide range of stimulus spaces [@shepard1987]. The first step in this process was establishing a stimulus space. For a stimulus domain like size, color, or even speech sounds, he used a procedure called "multidimensional scaling" to infer how stimulus items could be placed in a low-dimensional (often 2D) Cartesian space. Then, when he visualized generalization gradients within this space, he found the incredibly consistent pattern shown in Figure \@ref(fig:intro-shepard). Working backwards from this pattern, he was able to establish a derivation for this exponential generalization gradient that allowed him to claim it as a universal law. 

```{r intro-shepard, fig.cap="Figure 1 from Shepard (1987). Generalization gradients for twelve diffent kinds of stimuli."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro/shepard1987.png")
```
The pattern shown in Shepard's work is an example of **inductive theory building**. In the vocabulary we're developing, Shepard ran (or obtained the data from) **randomized experiments** in which the **manipulation** was stimulus dimension (e.g., circle size) and the **measure** was an explicit similarity judgment (e.g., how similar is this circle to that one). Then the theory that Shepard proposes links three **constructs** -- latent entities whose relationships the theory specifies. In particular, 1) similarity is used to derive 2) an internal psychological space, and 3) generalizations are then derived from distance in this space.

<!-- ^[If you have some background in the philosophy of science, you may be ready to call the philosophy police! If you're feeling that way, just wait -- we'll try to link some of our ideas to at least a lay understanding of the philosophy of science literature!] -->

<!-- Could it be that the "number game" judgments above are the same kinds of generalizations that Shepard observed in his analyses of perceptual data? @tenenbaum2001 presented a theory of similarity that preserved almost all of Shepard's assumptions, but did not require a continuous metric space at all. In its simplest form, the model just stated that the strength of a generalization was proportional to its specificity. This simplification allowed the model to be used to compute similarity and generalization for arbitrary domains, even the features of whole numbers! So for example, the property of being even does not confer much similarity because it is shared by half of all whole numbers; in contrast, being a power of 2 conveys much more because it is rarer. When applied to the number game, this model produced a close correspondence with human judgments.  -->

<!-- Since the development of this generalization model, it has been applied to a wide variety of domains including word learning [@xu2007], object exploration [@gweon2010], and sequential rule learning [@frank2011]. Yet this model has been critiqued as psychologically implausible [@endress2013], since it requires people to know a priori how specific each particular feature is. Further, the general framework within which the model was posed has been critiqued extensively for its assumption that human reasoning conforms to optimal statistical computations [@jones2011]. One way of thinking about these critiques is that they question which phenomena are in the scope of the theory: and in particular, whether Bayesian models should explain human psychological processes, or whether they are just a descriptive account of certain average behavioral outcomes. -->

<!-- In our discussion below, we'll look at the broader goal of theory building and how this kind of critique echoes some of the main tensions around what theories are for and how theories can be evaluated. -->
Shepard wrote in the conclusion of his 1987 paper, "Possibly, behind the diverse behaviors of humans and animals, as behind the various motions of planets and stars, we may discern the operation of universal laws." While Shepard's dream is an ambitious one, it defines one potential ideal for psychological theorizing. In our discussion below, we'll look at the broader goals of theory building and how theories can be evaluated.

## What is an experiment, and why would you do one?

<!-- - On one hand, experiments are “the worst way to learn about the world” (in the words of one of our mentors). “You can't play 20 questions with nature and win” (Newell 1973). But experiments are also one of our best tools for making strong causal inferences about the hidden structure of the world. They allow us to not just observe the world but to systematically intervene on it. -->
<!-- - We used to just poke things or people and measure what happened (see Hacking, 1990 on the 19th century craze of just measuring everything for fun.) Now we typically want our experiments to resolve deeper questions or test hypotheses. -->

When you do an experiment, you change the world in order to learn something new. This common-sense definition has two parts to it: the **manipulation** and the **measure**. The manipulation is the thing you are doing to the world, and the measure is the way you quantify the effects that your actions had. The manipulation licenses **causal inference**, which is our first topic. A second ingredient, **randomization**, licenses inferences about the locus of the causal effect. 
<!-- The result is some **generalization** that can be made about unseen observations.  -->
We'll talk about each of these in turn.

Let's think through an example. If you've ever tried to write a paper or even a tricky email while listening to vocal music with lyrics, you might have had the feeling that the lyrics of the music interfered with your own writing. Let's call this the "Dylan Hypothesis" -- listening to music like Bob Dylan's lyrically rich songs decreases writing skill in the moment while you're listening to its. 

The Dylan Hypothesis is a **causal hypothesis** -- meaning that we ascribe responsibility for the decrease in writing skill to this factor particularly.^[Defining causality is one of the trickiest and oldest problems in philosophy, and we won't attempt to solve it here! But from a psychological perspective, we're fond of @lewis1973's "counterfactual" analysis of causality. On this view, the Dylan Hypothesis amounts to the claim that, in some situation, if we *hadn't* played Dylan, we *wouldn't* have experienced a decrement in writing ability.] In what follows, we'll try to be precise about the causal inferences we're discussing. 

```{r intro-dylan1, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="The hypothesized causal relationship of the Dylan Hypothesis."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro/dylan1.png")
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:intro-dylan1), we show the Dylan Hypothesis using a kind of diagram called a **causal graphical model** [@pearl1998]. Our outcome is writing skill ($Y$) and our predictor is Dylan listening ($X$). The edge between them represents a hypothesized causal relationship. Dylan listening is hypothesized have to a causal effect on writing skill, and not vice versa. Now let's talk about how experiments allow us to make these causal inferences.

### Causal inference

Most science textbooks don't start a definition of what an experiment is; psychology textbooks are an exception [@winston1996]. Perhaps this is because experiments are a critical method for making strong causal inferences, which are otherwise in short supply in psychology, and so the contrast between experimental and non-experimental research is very salient for psychologists (and economists too). In contrast, the role of causality is much more straightforward in the physical sciences -- so straightforward that they don't talk about it at all. 

Causal inference is a central issue in any field that deals with human beings. People are very complex systems. Even from an intuitive perspective, there are many obvious factors -- personality, values,  culture, physiology, genes -- that influence any individual choice. Further, scientists typically have relatively limited opportunities to intervene on complex social systems. Although we can carry out some kinds of experiments within ethical and practical limits, we're not just allowed to go around doing what we want to the people around us, just to see what happens! This situation stands in stark contrast to the physical sciences: you can do pretty much anything you want with a chemical solution.

Returning to the Dylan Hypothesis, suppose we did an observational study where we measured our variables -- Dylan listening and writing quality -- in a large population.^[This sounds impractical, but let's imagine some kind of dystopian, Google Docs+Spotify surveillance in which the companies team up to monitor your writing and listening habits and provide quantitative estimates of writing quality and lyric density. Big data!] We might compute a correlation between $X$ and $Y$ and find some non-zero relationship between them. If we did this study, you might predict that listening to Dylan would be related to better writing.

```{r intro-dylan2, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Cofounding with age in the Dylan Hypothesis."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro/dylan2.png")
```

Can we make a causal inference? No. Correlation doesn't equal causation here. There is (at least one) confounding third variable: age ($Z$). Age is positively related to both Dylan listening and writing skill in our population of interest. Older people tend to be good writers and also tend to be more into folk rockers.^[We won't even put a question mark on this edge because it seems likely to be true.]

The causal relationship of age to our other two variables means that variation in $Z$ can induce a correlation in $X$ and $Y$, even in the absence of a true causal link. When $Z$ is higher, so are $X$ and $Y$ on average, so they are correlated. This gives us a slightly more precise definition of **confounding**, a concept that everyone learns to use and recognize in discussing experimental design. In our observational experiment, age is **confounded** with Dylan listening because it has a causal relationship with both the predictor and the outcome.^[There's a more technical definition that's more precise here: that is, age provides a "backdoor" from Dylan listening into writing skill. The "backdoor criterion" (it's really called that!) is a way to define confounding in more complex causal graphs.]

Experiments are when we intervene on the world and measure the consequences. Here, this means forcing some people to listen to Dylan. In the language of graphical models, if we control the Dylan listening, variable $X$ is causally exogenous -- not caused by anything else in the system). We "snipped" the causal link between age and Dylan listening, shown by the scissors icon in Figure \@ref(fig:intro-dylan3).

```{r intro-dylan3, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Experimental intervention snips the causal link between the confounded variable and the outcome."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro/dylan3.png")
```
In sum, experiments allow us to make strong causal inferences because they allow us to wield the causal scissors, severing the links that would ordinarily allow "upstream" variables like age to confound our inferences.^[There is a whole wonderful field of causal inference methods for non-experimental and pseudo-experimental designs. Much of this work happens in econometrics and not psychology, and the methods are extremely sophisticated. We recommend @cunningham2021 as an open access introductory text.]

### Randomization

When we talk about experiments in psychology, we are talking about experiments that are designed based on the logic of **comparison**. In the physical sciences, we can intervene on a system, comparing before and after the intervention. An example of a simple experiment would be to measure the temperature of some water, heat it, and then measure the temperature again. We feel relatively warranted in making the inference that the heat caused the temperature to rise. 

This logic feels sound because we believe that our action heating the water is the only thing that's different between our initial measurement (which we might call a **control** measurement^[Interestingly, this term is not much more than a hundred years old; it starts appearing in the medical literature in the 1890s and the psychological literature soon after that [@boring1954].]) and the measurement after our experimental intervention. It feels like we "held everything constant" between the two observations. This is  @mill1869's "method of differences": 

> If an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs, and an instance in which it does not occur, have every circumstance in common save one, that one occurring only in the former; the circumstance in which alone the two instances differ, is the effect, or the cause, or an indispensable part of the cause, of the phenomenon.” 

\noindent In other words, comparison allows for causal inferences. 

The trouble is that it's not always as easy to "hold everything constant." Let's do two different analogously-designed Dylan Hypothesis experiments. The first will be a **within-participants** design. We ask someone to produce two writing samples for us to rate; the first is written in silence and the second while listening to *Blood on the Tracks*. Now we have a problem: our two measurements occur at different times. Being the second observation as opposed to the first might have a causal effect on writing skill -- perhaps the participant practiced, perhaps they feel more comfortable in our experimental setup. Perhaps they feel more tired. In other words, we have introduced another confound -- this time between parts of the experiment and Dylan listening. 

```{r intro-dylan4, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Confounding with order."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro/dylan4.png")
```
Here's our second experimental design, a **between-participants** design.
We get some individuals to listen to Dylan or not -- say we have our parents listen to Dylan and our friends do the experiment in silence -- and then measure their writing during the assigned listening (or non-listening) period. Now we have a different issue. The participants in the control and experimental (Dylan) are  different from one another. Even though we intervened in the world, we might as well be in the situation of Figure \@ref(fig:intro-dylan2), in the sense that we have differences between our participants that could make a causal difference (e.g., their age). Again, it doesn't seem like everything got held constant.

Although structurally these two situations are quite different, they have a single theoretical solution: **randomization**. Randomization -- whether of the order of an intervention in a sequence or the assignment of participants to conditions -- is the key intervention that is guaranteed to break causal dependencies. In the case of the order confound, random assignment of condition order guarantees that our estimate of Dylan on writing skill is **unbiased**^[Unbiased with respect to order, of course! It could be biased by many other things.] on average.^[It could be biased in any one situation. Because order has two known states, we can also **balance** order rather than randomizing it. We'll talk in some depth in Chapter \@ref(design) about how to deal with these sorts of nuisance procedural confounds and when randomization vs. counterbalancing strategies are most appropriate.] In the case of the participant confound, **random assignment** of participants to conditions is the key step that breaks the connection between the myriad confounds related to individual participants' identities and the manipulation of interest. 

Random assignment is so central to the recipe of experimental psychology that sometimes we don't even think about it as an ingredient! But without it, the cake simply doesn't rise. One classic example of a violation of random assignment is the sequential recruitment of participants to conditions (e.g., first testing the non-Dylan group and then the Dylan group). This kind of practice can seem unproblematic to a reseach assistant carrying out a study (we've done it!). But it confounds time with group participation and can lead to all sorts of unforeseen issues in causal inference. Imagine that Dylan wins the Nobel prize somewhere during the recruitment process. This event obviously could change the nature of your manipulation. But so could infinite other events -- from a global pandemic all the way to the normal course of the seasons changing. Random assignment is the only way to avoid these confounds. 

Random assignment is great, but there is a caveat. Random assignment cannot rescue your *individual* sample from biases. For example, in your randomly-assigned conditions, maybe a few more Dylan condition participants happened to be run after his Nobel than before. Instead, random assignment guarantees that *on average* your estimate of the causal effect will be unbiased -- even if you get lucky or unlucky on this individual instance of your experiment.^[We'll return to the topic of whether you should test for or adjust for "unhappy randomization" in Chapter \@ref(models). A brief answer here, to pique your curiosity: no.] That's pretty good, and maybe it's the best you can hope for!

<!-- ### Generalization -->

<!-- A third feature of typical psychology experiments is the desire to generalize from a **sample** to a **population**. Our causal effect of interest is not the effect of Dylan on *these particular* participants, it's the predicted effect for the population we are sampling from.  -->

<!-- This kind of statement gets us into deep water quite quickly because it raises questions about what populations we want to theorize about and in turn how we would sample in such a way as to make these inferences valid. We're going to discuss these issues in Chapter \@ref(sampling).  -->

## What is a theory? 

Experiments are a terrible way to learn about the world. They are costly and time-consuming, and sometimes they fail in uninterpretable ways. Yet they are our best way to estimate causal effects. Sometimes we just need to know about the existence or magnitude effects for some applied goal, say deciding whether implementing a particular curriculum will lead to changes in mathematics test scores. But often we want to do more. The "extra" thing we would like to do is to build theories. 

If you have a single experimental result, you don't need to construct a theory. But once you have accumulated several experimental results, keeping track of them as a separate entities can become very difficult. As @newell1973 remarked, "you can't play 20 questions with nature and win": eventually you need to synthesize your results into some sort of theory. This theory acts as a "compression" of the experimental data, allowing you to remember generalizations rather than just a list of specifics; the specifics can then be reconstructed from the generalizations [@mach1882].



But what is a theory? We'll begin by talking about the specific enterprise of constructing psychological theories. We'll then move to discussing how theories make contact with experiments. Philosophers of science have discussed this issue extensively and we'll give you the briefest of tours of the landscape here since some of the key issues in topics like replication (Chapter \@ref(replication) and inference (Chapter \@ref(inference)) make use of this material. Finally, we'll discuss the role of formalized, quantitative models in psychological theorizing (connecting to our discussion of statistical modeling in Chapter \@ref(models)). 

### Psychological theories

A psychological theory is a set of proposed causal relationships among variables. For the most part, the variables we theorize about are unseen (latent) entities that we call **constructs**. Constructs can range widely in specificity. *g* (general intelligence) is the classic psychological example of a broad construct. In contrast, the psychological distance metric that Shepard used in our case study above is a rather more specific example.^[A tradition of research in cognitive science posits that human knowledge is organized into theories [@gopnik1994], and that in particular we organize our knowledge about other people into an **intuitive theory of psychology**. This intuitive theory includes concepts like "belief," "desire," and "emotion", but it's important to distinguish the constructs we posit in *psychological* theories from the terms in our *intuitive* theories. Often one is grounded in the other, but the failure to distinguish the two can lead to sloppy reasoning.] Theories then are groups of assumptions about the relationships between these constructs. 

Occasionally, defining a construct is enough to describe a theory. Defining general intelligence as *g*, the shared variance between different tests of intelligence, is itself a theoretically-loaded move. But more frequently the constructs gain their meaning in part via their relationship to other constructs. For example, in Shepard's theory, while *generalization* and *distance* were the two key constructs, the substantive part of the theory was the quantitative links between the two that he posited.

```{r intro-shepard-net, fig.cap="A causal model (\"nomological network\" for Shepard's universal law.", fig.margin=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro/shepard_network.png")
```

This web of constructs and assumptions is what @cronbach1955 referred to as a **nomological network** -- a set of proposals about how different entities are connected to one another. This idea is illustrated by the philosopher of science @hempel1952, who wrote that:

> A scientific theory might... be likened to a complex spatial network: Its terms are represented by the knots, while the threads connecting the latter correspond, in part, to the definitions and, in part to the fundamental and derivative hypotheses included in the theory. The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by rules of interpretation.These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of those interpretive connections, the network can function as a scientific theory: From certain observational data, we may ascend, via an interpretive string, to some point in the theoretical network, thence proceed, via definitions and hypotheses, to other points, from which another interpretive string permits a descent to the plane of observation. (p. 36)

One way to sketch this kind of network would be to use the kind of causal graph we used above. So then a nomological network looks like a causal model linking a set of constructs. Shepard's proposal about generalization could be drawn this way (Figure \@ref(fig:intro-shepard-net)), but notice that the arrow connecting distance and generalization is doing a lot of work! Shepard's proposal wasn't just that there was *some* causal link between these two constructs, but that this relationship had a very specific parametric form.^[Calling the theory a "network" sounds like it's a **structural equation model** (SEM) where there are circles and lines and the lines represent something akin to the correlations between the numbers in the circles. That's one way to define a psychological theory, but it's certainly not the only way! Structural equation models are also primarily designed for observational data, they don't encode causal hypotheses the way we've been talking about them.]


Having such a theory allows you to **explain** and **predict**; both of these are good things for a theory to do. A theory provides a compression of potentially complex data into a smaller set of general factors whose interactions produce the observed data. Thus, a theory is doing its job if it allows you to say things like "factor A was responsible for effect B." Shepard's theory fulfills both of these criteria. It's explanatory in the sense that it allows you to answer questions like "why is generalization so much lower for shapes that are a bit further apart in psychological space" or broader questions like "why does psychological generalization have an exponential form." And it's also predictive in that it suggests the (quantitative) consequence for generalization judgments that should result from a particular manipulation of distance.

### Theory testing: Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos, oh my!

We have said that experiments allow the estimation of causal effects and theories describe causal relationships. How do theories make contact with evidence? Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is no consensus around this topic in the philosophy of science. Yet there are viewpoints on theory construction and testing that have emerged that are very useful for the working scientist to know about. We'll introduce one normative view of what theories are (and how they should be evaluated) that resonates with many scientists: Popper's **falsificationism**. We'll then discuss three critiques of this viewpoint: 1) the descriptive challenge posed by @kuhn1962, 2) the challenge of holism, and 3) questions about confirmation that come from modern Bayesian views.^[This is nowhere near a comprehensive introduction to this huge topic. Instead, we're just picking and choosing a couple of topics that help set up discussions we'll be having throughout the rest of the book. For a very readable introduction to the broader field, we recommend @godfrey-smith2009.] 

For Popper, a scientific theory is a set of generalizations about the world. These generalizations embody substantive hypotheses (like "lyrically dense music decreases writing ability"). What makes such a statement a scientific hypothesis is that it is falsifiable, for example by an observation that contradicts it (someone not experiencing such a decrease despite listening to Dylan). On this view, theories are never **confirmed** -- they are posited and then at best can fail to be falsified for many years, despite repeated attempts to do so. 

Popper's viewpoint is appealing. The logic of falsificationism resonates with many scientists, who view themselves as trying to make correct generalizations with increasing scope and then to subject these to increasingly stringent tests. On the other hand, it has a number of serious weaknesses that mean that it's not a great tool with which to analyze scientific practices (which is something we'd like to do here). Ideally our philosophy of science should give us a sense of what we are doing when we attempt to construct theories and do experiments.

**The descriptive challenge.** A highly influential critique of Popper (and other related viewpoints that treat scientific progress as making logical generalizations) comes from the sociological and historical work of @kuhn1962. Kuhn studied scientific revolutions and suggested that they looked nothing like the falsification of a clear generalization via an incontrovertible observation. Instead, Kuhn described scientists as mostly working within **paradigms**. These paradigms are sets of questions, assumptions, methods, phenomena, and explanatory hypotheses that together allow for activities Kuhn described as **normal science** -- that is, testing questions within the paradigm, explaining new observations or modifying theory to fit these paradigms. 

On Kuhn's view, normal science is punctuated by periods of **crisis** and and **revolution** when the working assumptions of the paradigm break down. This doesn't happen just because a single observation is inconsistent with the current set of assumptions (as falsification would suggest). Rather, there will often be a transition to a new paradigm that typically involves a striking success (such as the transition to a heliocentric viewpoint in astronomy). 

For Popper, subsequent theories necessarily contain better generalizations and have greater scope. For Kuhn, that's not necessarily true. Paradigms are **incommensurable** with one another. The new paradigm doesn't necessarily explain all the same things the old one did (or test its hypotheses via the same measures). This is often very disconcerting for scientists because they like the feeling that they are moving towards ever greater truth. 

On the other hand, in psychology, there are clear examples of paradigm shifts where the new paradigm does not subsume the old one. For example, behaviorist psychology produced a series of reliable generalizations about particular phenomena in animal learning (e.g., operant conditioning). The cognitive revolution that followed led to a transition in research topics, experimental methods, and theories, but the cognitivist theories did not typically provide an alternative account of conditioning behaviors. The sense in which behaviorism was overturned was that its scope was narrowed and fewer researchers focused on it as an account of other phenomena in language and mind.

The example of behaviorism is probably a relatively rare example of a true Kuhnian paradigm in psychology.^[If you are interested in a perspective on this paradigm shift, [here's a relevant essay](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/what-happened-to-behaviorism).] Mostly we aren't thinking of the entire discipline changing at once. To deal with this more incremental change, @lakatos1976 defines the notion of **research programs** that are more like little paradigms that can run in parallel with one another. A research program is a set of hypotheses, phenomena, and methods that all cohere together and allow for progress in their explanatory and predictive scope. Psychology -- even experimental psychology -- to us looks more like it has a series of interconnected research programs than one big paradigm. When one research program seems like it's not going anywhere, researchers are free to jump ship to another more promising one. 

**The challenge of holism**. A second point that makes Popper's falsificationism a bad match for working scientists is the observation that no individual hypothesis can be falsified independently. Instead, the reasoning about whether a hypothesis relies on a large series of what are called **auxiliary hypotheses** that are necessary to link the observation to the theory. To take our running example, if we found no decrement in writing skill in one of our planned experiments, that observation might still not falsify the Dylan Hypothesis. Instead, the fault might be in any one of our auxiliary assumptions, like our measurement of writing skill, or our choice of Dylan songs. One major source of auxiliary hypotheses in psychology is the process of making variables like "writing skill" or "listening to lyrically-dense music" into concrete statements that make contact with the world. 

The consequence of holism for psychology research is that we often must reason about our experimental observations through the lens of these auxiliary hypotheses. An unexpected observation may cause us to give up on our main hypothesis -- but it will often cause us to question our auxiliary assumptions instead (or as well). The work of developing good measures that we discuss in Chapter \@ref(measurement) is tightly related. Selecting or creating a good measure is basically the same thing as considering the auxiliary assumption that your measure is a good stand-in for a quantity like writing skill. 

**Bayesian confirmation**. The final issue to raise with falsificationism is that on this view, theories are never confirmed, but rather only falsified. This idea is at odds with much of the intuitive way that scientists feel that they work. We often describe what we do as deriving a prediction from a theory, testing that prediction, and then feeling that our theory has gained credibility from the observations that are consistent with it. A falsificationist says that this sensation is an illusion and in fact the theory is simply surviving to be tested another day. 

An alternative perspective comes from the Bayesian tradition that we'll learn more about in Chapters \@ref(estimation) and \@ref(inference). In a nutshell, Bayesians consider the idea that our subjective belief in a particular hypothesis can be captured by a probability, and that our scientific reasoning can then be described by a  process of normative probabilistic reasoning [@strevens2006]. The Bayesian scientist distributes probability across a wide range of alternative hypotheses; observations that are more consistent with a hypothesis increase its probability [@sprenger2019]. This view is both intuitively plausible and empirically a nice match to people's reasoning, as shown by research building on Shepard's [@tenenbaum2001]!

In sum, there's no one view on the processes of theory testing and revision. If we think of a theory as a posited set of causal relationships, then it's clear that we can't just put this theory in direct contact with evidence. We need to think about its scope of application (in terms of the phenomena and measures its meant to have scope over), as well as the auxiliary hypotheses that link it to specific observations and the alternative theories that we are comparing it to. 


<!-- ^[We might also want to add to the theory some assumptions about how these constructs ground out into measurements. Some philosophers of science distinguish between the "core" assumptions of a theory and the "periphery" -- and we might be tempted to say that specific measurements are peripheral. If we came up with a better measure of the construct, or it turned out that our measure wasn't particularly good, we could replace it without too much damage to the underlying theory.] -->


### Models and theories 

Say we have a set of constructs whose relationship we are interested in. How do we describe this relationship? There is no one single vocabulary for psychological theories. Some relationships are stated qualitatively via **verbal theories** while others are stated quantitatively in **formal theories**. 

Much of the psychology literature from Freud onward consists of verbal theories, including our Dylan Hypothesis. We could even elaborate this hypothesis into Dylan Theory, with some hypothesized mechanism such as "verbal processing resources" that might be exhausted by both listening and writing at the same time. The strength of verbal theories is that they can be expressed and communicated easily. But typically their predictions are at best qualitative in nature. In our discussion of the Dylan Hypothesis, we just expected writing skill to go down while listening, and so we would have accepted any decrement as evidence confirming our hypothesis. 

It's very hard to make a strong test of a theory that makes only qualitative predictions [@meehl1990]. For example, if we fail to see a decrement in writing skill while listening to Dylan, we can typically call on one of our auxiliary assumptions to salvage the issue. Because we have no quantitative expectations about how big a difference our auxiliary variables should make, it's quite plausible they could erase or even reverse our effect. Language is also vague and context sensitive [@grice1975]. While these are arguably positive features from a communication perspective, they can lead to disagreements about the interpretation of a theory unless substantial care is taken in its expression. 

The answer to these issues is to theorize using a framework such as a logical, mathematical, or statistical formalism. From a philosophical perspective, it's perhaps surprising that mathematics is so "unreasonably effective" as a vocabulary for the science [@wigner1990]. But some sort of formalism is necessary for a theory to make quantitative predictions. Indeed, there have been calls for greater formalization of theory in psychology for at least the last 50 years [@harris1976].^[Due to the recent suggestion that we are in a "theory crisis"  (e.g., that psychology lacks theory; cf. Chapter \@ref(replication)), recently there have been a spate of articles advocating for the development of formal theories throughout psychology [@oberauer2019;@smaldino2020].]

There is no one framework that will be right for theorizing across all areas of psychology. Mathematical theories like Shepard's have long been one tool that allows for precise and parametric statement of particular relationships. Yet stating such clear and general laws feels out of reach in many cases. If we had more Shepard-style theorists or theories, perhaps we'd be in a better place. Or perhaps such "universal laws" are simply out of reach for most of human behavior. 

An alternative approach creates and fits models of data that incorporate substantive assumptions about the structure of the data. The structural equation models we referred to above are one example of this approach, where linear regression -- in combination with some assumptions about which measurement is related to what -- is used to infer the strength of relationships. 

Models that start from data are what we use all the time for data analysis. The trouble is, we often don't interpret them as having substantive assumptions about the structure of the data, even when they do! For example, the choice of a linear regression implies a number of assumptions about how measurements are distributed and how they relate to your manipulation. For example, we could fit a simple regression model to our Dylan Hypothesis data, predicting writing skill as a function of condition. This model would yield a coefficient estimate estimating the effect of Dylan on writing skill. If we were drawing our theory, we could then put that estimate on the line between the two constructs.

This simple example raises all kinds of questions. What are the *units* of the relationship we're describing? How do we generalize this theory to other music beyond the Dylan album we used? How specific is our estimate to the writing task we used? Should we expect this estimate to hold for other populations. From our viewpoint, these sorts of questions are not distractions -- they are the critical work of moving from experiment to theory! If we declared success via observing $p<.05$ and moved on, we would not have avoided these questions but rather just ignored them.

Linear models in particular are ubiquitous in the social sciences because they are convenient to fit, but as theoretical models they are deeply impoverished. There is a lot you can do with a linear regression, but in the end, most interesting processes are not linear combinations of factors! In Chapter \@ref(models) we try to draw out this idea further, reconstruing common statistical tests as models that can be repurposed to express contentful scientific hypotheses while recognizing the limitations of their assumptions.

One of the strengths of modern cognitive science is that it provides a very rich set of tools for expressing more complex models. For example, the modern Bayesian cognitive modeling tradition grew out of work like Shepard's; in these models, a system of equations defines a probability distribution that can be used to estimate parameters, predict new data, or make other inferences [@probmods2]. And neural network models -- which are now fueling innovations in artificial intelligence --  have a long history of being used as substantive models of human psychology [@elman1996].

Computational or formal artifacts are not themselves psychological theories, but all of them can be used to create psychological theories via the mapping of constructs onto entities in the model and the use of the principles of the formalism to instantiate psychological hypotheses or assumptions. This book won't go into more details about routes to building computational theories, but if you are interested, we encourage you to explore these frameworks as a way to deepen your theoretical contributions and to sharpen your experimental choices.

## Theory testing in psychology

Say we have a theory like Shepard's universal law or the Dylan Hypothesis. How should we go about putting this in contact with data? If we wanted to follow Popper's falsification strategy, we should simply go ahead and start deriving predictions from the theory, then checking to see if it is falsified. But without further guidance, this strategy might be pretty boring. In the classic example that's used in the philosophy literature, this is like going around checking each and every swan to see if all swans are white, just hoping to find a black swan to falsify your generalization. Maybe we don't know how to do better with swans but we do with scientific observations. 

### "Risky tests" 

The key insight of theory testing is that you should look for observations that are likely for your theory but unlikely for other theories. @meehl1978 calls these "risky tests." 

### Theories, frameworks, and paradigms

You may be thinking at this point in the chapter, "psychology is full of theories but they don't look that much like what you're talking about!" Very few of the theories that bear that label in psychology are explicitly

Here's an example. @bronfenbrenner1992's ecological systems theory is pictured in Figure \@ref(fig:intro-bronfenbrenner). The key thesis of this theory is that children's development occurs in a set of nested contexts that each affect one another and in turn affect the child. This theory has been immensely influential, for example by supporting a more ecological model in social work [@ungar2002].

## Experiments and Theories: Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we defined an experiment as a combination of a manipulation and a measure. This combination, along with randomization, licenses strong causal inferences about the structure of the world. Because they provide strong evidence on causality, experiments

Theories with high predictive value are not necessarily causal or parsimonious (e.g., a black-box neural network model that predicts heart disease risk). Meanwhile, theories with high explanatory value may only account for a small proportion of overall variance in a behavior (e.g. a theory of lexical priming that introduces a new, causal role of accessibility). -->
