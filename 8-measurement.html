<p>Throughout the history of science, advances in measurement have gone hand in hand with advances in knowledge.<label for="tufte-sn-122" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">122</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-122" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">122</span> As such, measurement is a perennially controversial topic in philosophy of science. For an overview of competing frameworks, see <span class="citation">Tal (<a href="#ref-sep-measurement-science" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> or <span class="citation">Maul, Irribarra, and Wilson (<a href="#ref-maul2016philosophical" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>, which focuses specifically on measurement in psychology.</span> Telescopes revolutionized astronomy, microscopes revolutionized biology, and patch clamping revolutionized physiology. But measurement isn’t easy. Even the humble thermometer, allowing reliable measurement of temperature, required centuries of painstaking effort to perfect <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chang2004inventing" role="doc-biblioref">Chang 2004</a>)</span>. Psychology and the behavioral sciences are no different – we need reliable instruments to measure the things we care about. In this next section of the book, we’re going to discuss the challenges facing measurement in psychology, and the properties that distinguish good instruments from bad.</p>
<p>What does it mean to measure something? Intuitively, we know that a ruler measures the quantity of length, and a scale measures the quantity of weight <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kisch1965scales" role="doc-biblioref">Kisch 1965</a>)</span>. But what does it mean to measure a psychological construct – a hypothesized theoretical quantity inside the head? According to <span class="citation">Stevens (<a href="#ref-stevens1946" role="doc-biblioref">1946</a>)</span>, measurement is simply the practice of assigning numbers to things. But, to paraphrase <span class="citation">Norman R. Campbell and Jeffreys (<a href="#ref-campbell1938symposium" role="doc-biblioref">1938</a>)</span>, not every assignment of numbers is measurement! Roughly speaking, we want the numbers we assign to behave like the constructs we’re assigning them to (in the ways that matter). And not all measurement instruments are created equal.</p>
<p>This point is obvious when you think about physical measurement instruments: a caliper will give you a much more precise estimate of the thickness of a small object than a ruler. One way to see that the measurement is more precise is by repeating it a bunch of times. The measurements from the caliper will likely be more similar to one another, reflecting the fact that the amount of error in each individual measurement is smaller. We can do the same thing with a psychological measurement – repeat and assess variation – though as we’ll see below it’s a little trickier. Measurement instruments that have less error are called more <strong>reliable</strong> instruments.<label for="tufte-sn-123" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">123</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-123" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">123</span> Is <strong>reliability</strong> the same as <strong>precision</strong>? Yes, more or less. Confusingly, different fields call these concepts different things <span class="citation">(there’s a helpful table of these names in <a href="#ref-brandmaier2018" role="doc-biblioref">Brandmaier et al. 2018</a>)</span>. Here we’ll talk about reliability as a property of instruments specifically while using the term precision to talk about the measurements themselves.</span></p>
<p>When we have a physical quantity of interest, we can assess how well an instrument measures that quantity. But things are much trickier when the construct we are trying to measure can’t be assessed directly. We have to measure something observable – our operationalization of the construct – and then make an argument about how the measure relates to the construct of interest. This is an argument for the <strong>validity</strong> of measurements from the instrument.<label for="tufte-sn-124" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">124</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-124" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">124</span> We are also going to talk in Chapter <a href="9-design.html#design">9</a> about the validity of manipulations. The way you identify a causal effect on some measure is by operationalizing some construct as well. If this is done badly, the manipulation can be invalid – meaning the causal effect that’s measured doesn’t map onto the construct.</span></p>
<p>These two concepts, reliability and validity, provide a conceptual toolkit for assessing how good a psychological measurement instrument is.</p>

<p>Reliability is a way of describing the extent to which a measure yields signal relative to noise. Intuitively, if there’s less noise, then there will be more similarity between different measurements of the same quantity, illustrated in Figure <a href="8-measurement.html#fig:measurement-brandmaier">8.4</a> as a tighter grouping of points on the bulls-eye. But how do we measure signal and noise?</p>

</span>
</p>
<p>In the physical sciences, it’s common to measure the precision of an instrument by quantifying its coefficient of variation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brandmaier2018" role="doc-biblioref">Brandmaier et al. 2018</a>)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[CV = \frac{\sigma_w}{\mu_w}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_w\)</span> is the standard deviation of the measurements within an individual and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_w\)</span> is the mean of those measurements (Figure <a href="8-measurement.html#fig:measurement-cv">8.5</a>).</p>
<p>Imagine we measure the height of a person five times, resulting in measurements of 171cm, 172cm, 171cm, 173cm, and 172cm. These are the combination of the person’s true height (we assume they have one!) and some <strong>measurement error</strong>. Now we can use these measurements to compute the coefficient of variation, which is 0.005. Why can’t we just do that with psychological measurements?</p>

<p>Thinking about this question takes us on a detour through the different kinds of measurement scales used in psychological research <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stevens1946" role="doc-biblioref">Stevens 1946</a>)</span>. The height measurements in our example are on what is known as a <strong>ratio</strong> scale: a scale in which numerical measurements are equally spaced and on which there is a true zero point. These scales are common for physical quantities but actually quite infrequent in psychology. More common are <strong>interval</strong> scales, in which there is no true zero point. For example, IQ (and other standardized scores) are intended to capture interval variation on some dimension but 0 is meaningless – an IQ of 0 does not correspond to any particular interpretation.<label for="tufte-sn-125" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">125</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-125" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">125</span> It can actually be shown in a suitably rigorous sense that ratio and interval scales (and another lying in between) are the <em>only</em> scales possible for the real numbers <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-narens1986measurement" role="doc-biblioref">Narens and Luce 1986</a>)</span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ordinal</strong> scales are also commonly used. These are scales that are ordered but are not necessarily spaced equally. For example, levels of educational achievement (“Elementary”,“High school”,“Some college”,“College”,“Graduate school”) are ordered, but there is no sense in which “High school” is as far from “Elementary” as “Graduate school” is from “College.” The last type in Stevens’ hierarchy is <strong>nominal</strong> scales, in which no ordering is possible either. For example, race is an unordered scale in which multiple categories are present but there is no inherent ordering of these categories. The full hierarchy is presented in Table <a href="8-measurement.html#tab:measurement-stevens-table">8.1</a>.</p>
<p>Critically, different summary measures work for each scale type. If you have an unordered list like a list of options for a question about race on a survey, you can present the modal response (the most likely one). It doesn’t even make sense to think about what the median was – there’s no ordering! For ordered levels of education, a median is possible but you can’t compute a mean. And for interval variables like “number of correct answers on a math test” you can compute a mean and a standard deviation.<label for="tufte-sn-126" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">126</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-126" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">126</span> You might be tempted to think that “number of correct answers” is a ratio variable – but is zero really meaningful? Does it truly correspond to “no math knowledge” or is it just a stand-in for “less math knowledge than this test requires”?</span></p>
<p>Now we’re ready to answer our initial question about why we can’t quantify reliability using the coefficient of variation. Unless you have a ratio scale with a true zero, you can’t compute a coefficient of variation. Think about it for IQ scores: currently, by convention, standardized IQ scores are set to have a mean of 100. If we tested someone multiple times and found the standard deviation of their test scores was 4 points, then we could estimate the precision of their measurements as “CV” of 4/100 = .04. But since IQ of 0 isn’t meaningful, we could just set the mean IQ for the population to 200. Our test would be the same, and so the CV would be 4/200 = .02. On that logic we just doubled the precision of our measurements by rescaling the test! That doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<div id="measuring-reliability" class="section level3" number="8.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.2</span> Measuring reliability</h3>
<p>So then how do we measure signal and noise when we don’t have a true zero? We can still look at the variation between repeated measurement, but rather than comparing that variation between measurements to the mean, we can compare it to some other kind of variation, for example, variation between people. In what follows, we’ll discuss reliability on interval scales, but many of the same tools have been developed for ordinal and nominal scales.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are developing an instrument to measure some cognitive ability. We assume that every participant has a true ability, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, just the same way that they have a true height in the example above. Every time we measure this true ability with our instrument, however, it gets messed up by some measurement error. Let’s specify that error is normally distributed with a mean of zero – so it doesn’t <strong>bias</strong> the measurements, it just adds noise. The result is our observed score, <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-127" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">127</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-127" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">127</span> The approach we use to introduce this set of ideas is called <strong>classical test theory</strong>. There are other – more modern – alternative approaches, but CTT (as it’s called) is a good starting point for thinking through the concepts.</span></p>
<p>Taking this approach, we could define a relative version of the coefficient of variation. The idea is that the reliability of a measurement is the amount of variance attributable to the true score variance (signal), rather than the observed score variance (which includes noise). If <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_t\)</span> is the variance of the true scores and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_o\)</span> is the variance of the observed scores, then this ratio is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R = \frac{\sigma^2_t}{\sigma^2_o}.
\]</span>
When noise is high, then the denominator is going to be big and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> will go down to 0; when noise is low, the numerator and the denominator will be almost the same and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> will approach 1.</p>
<p>This all sounds great, except for one problem: we can’t compute reliability using this formula without knowing true ability scores and their variance. But if we knew those, we wouldn’t need to measure anything at all! To get around this fundamental issue, there are two main approaches to computing reliability from data.</p>
<p>
<span class="marginnote shownote">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:measurement-trt"></span>
<img src="images/measurement/trt.png" alt="Computing test-retest reliability." width="\linewidth"/>
Figure 8.6: Computing test-retest reliability.
</span>
</p>
<p><strong>Test-retest reliability</strong>. Imagine you have two parallel versions of your instrument that are the same difficulty and hence reflect the same true score for each participant you assess. In that case, you can use these two measurement to compute the reliability of the instrument by simply computing the correlation between the two scores. The logic is that, if both variants reflect the same true score, then the shared variance (<strong>covariance</strong>) between them is just <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_t\)</span>, the true score variance, which is the variable that we wanted but didn’t have. Test-retest reliability is thus a very convenient way to measure reliability (Figure <a href="8-measurement.html#fig:measurement-trt">8.6</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Internal reliability</strong>. If you don’t have two parallel versions of an instrument, or you can’t give the test twice for whatever reason, then you have another option. Assuming your instrument has multiple items – e.g., multiple survey questions or multiple math problems – then you can split the test in pieces and treat the scores from each of these sub-parts as parallel versions of the instrument. The simplest way to do this is to split the instrument in half and compute the correlation between participants’ scores on the two halves – this quantity is called <strong>split half reliability</strong>.<label for="tufte-sn-128" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">128</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-128" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">128</span> The problem is that each half is… half as long as the original instrument. To get around this, there is a correction called the Spearman-Brown correction that can be applied to estimate the expected correlation for the full-length instrument.</span></p>
<p>Another method for computing the internal reliability (the <strong>consistency</strong> of a test) is to treat each item as a sub-instrument and compute the average split-half correlation over all splits. This method yields the statistic <strong>Cronbach’s alpha</strong>. Alpha is a widely reported statistic, but it is also widely misinterpreted <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sijtsma2009" role="doc-biblioref">Sijtsma 2009</a>)</span>. First, it is actually a lower bound on reliability rather than a good estimate of reliability itself. And second, it is often misinterpreted as evidence that an instrument yields scores that are “internally consistent,” which it does not; it’s not an accurate summary of dimensionality. Alpha is a standard statistic, but it should be used with caution.</p>





<p>One final note: these tools often get used for observers’ ratings of the same stimulus (<strong>inter-rater</strong> or <strong>inter-annotator reliability</strong>), say for example when you have two coders rate how aggressive a person seems in a video. The most common measure of inter-annotator agreement is a categorical measure called Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span>, for categorical agreement, but you can use ICCs for continuous data as well as many other measures.</p>

<div id="practical-advice-for-computing-reliability" class="section level3" number="8.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.3</span> Practical advice for computing reliability</h3>
<p>Ignorance is not bliss. If you don’t know the reliability of your measures for an experiment, you risk wasting your and your participants’ time. A higher reliability measure will lead to more precise measurements of a causal effect of interest and hence smaller sample sizes.<label for="tufte-sn-129" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">129</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-129" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">129</span> Low-reliability measures also limit your ability to detect correlations between measurements. One of us spent several fruitless months in graduate school running dozens of participants through batteries of language processing tasks and correlating the results across tasks. This exercise was a waste of time because most of the tasks were of such low reliability that, even had they been highly correlated with another task, this relationship would have been almost impossible to detect without a huge sample size. One rule of thumb that’s helpful for individual difference designs of this sort is that the maximal correlation that can be observed between two variables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the square root of the product of their reliabilities: <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{r_x r_y}\)</span>. So if you have two measures that are reliable at .25, the maximal measured correlation between them is .25 as well! This kind of method is now frequently used in cognitive neuroscience (and other fields as well) to compute the so-called <strong>noise ceiling</strong> for a measure: the maximum amount of signal that in principle <em>could</em> be predicted <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lage-castellanos2019" role="doc-biblioref">Lage-Castellanos et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</span></p>
<p>Test-retest reliability is generally the most conservative practical measure of reliability. Test-retest reliability estimates include not only measurement error but also participants’ state variation across different testing sessions and variance due to differences between versions of your instrument. These real-world quantities are absent from internal reliability estimates, which may make you erroneously think that there is more signal present in your instrument than there is.<label for="tufte-sn-130" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">130</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-130" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">130</span> Even though alpha is a theoretical lower bound on reliability, in practice, test-retest accuracy often ends up lower than alpha because it incorporates all these other sources of variation.</span> It’s hard work to measure test-retest reliability estimates, but if you plan on using an instrument more than once or twice, it will likely be worthwhile!</p>
<p>Finally, if you have multiple measurement items as part of your instrument, make sure you evaluate how they contribute to the reliability of the instrument. Perhaps you have several questions in a survey that you’d like to use to measure the same construct; perhaps multiple experimental vignettes that vary in content or difficulty. Some of these items may not contribute to your instrument’s reliability – and some may even detract. At a bare minimum, you should always visualize the distribution of responses across items to scan for <strong>floor and ceiling effects</strong> – when items always yield responses bunched at the bottom or top of the scale, limiting their usefulness – and take a look at whether there are particular items on which items do not relate to the others. If you are thinking about developing an instrument that you use repeatedly, it may be useful to use more sophisticated psychometric models to estimate the dimensionality of responses on your instrument as well as the properties of the individual items <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-furr2021" role="doc-biblioref">Furr 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-embretson2013" role="doc-biblioref">Embretson and Reise 2013</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Validity</h2>
<p>In Chapter <a href="2-theories.html#theories">2</a>, we talked about the process of theory building as a process of describing the relationships between constructs. But for the theory to be tested, the constructs must be measured so that you can test the relationships between them! Measurement and measure construction is therefore intimately related to theory construction, and the notion of validity is central.</p>
<p>A valid instrument measures the construct of interest. In Figure <a href="8-measurement.html#fig:measurement-brandmaier">8.4</a>, invalidity is pictured as bias – the holes in the target are tightly grouped but in the wrong place.<label for="tufte-sn-131" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">131</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-131" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">131</span> This metaphor is a good rough guide but it doesn’t distinguish an instrument that is systematically biased (for example, by estimating scores too low for one group) and one that is invalid (because it measures the wrong construct).</span> How can you tell if a measure is valid, given that the construct of interest is unobserved? There is no single test of the validity of a measure <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cronbach1955" role="doc-biblioref">Cronbach and Meehl 1955</a>)</span>. Rather, the measure is valid if there is evidence that it fits into the nomological network – the network of predicted relationships with other constructs and their measures.</p>
<p>Validity is typically established via an argument that calls on different sources of support <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kane1992" role="doc-biblioref">Kane 1992</a>)</span>. Here are some of the ways that you might support the relationship between a measure and a construct:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Face validity</strong>: The measure looks like the construct, such that intuitively it is reasonable that it measures the construct.</li>
<li><strong>Ecological validity</strong>: The measure incorporates how the construct is used in people’s lives.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Internal validity</strong>: Usually used negatively. A “challenge to internal validity” is a description of a case where the measure is administered in such a way as to weaken the relationship between measure and construct.<label for="tufte-sn-132" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">132</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-132" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">132</span> Often this concept is described as only being relevant to the validity of a manipulation, e.g. when the manipulation of the construct is confounded and some other psychological variable is manipulated as well. We discuss internal validity further in Chapter <a href="9-design.html#design">9</a>.</span></li>
<li><strong>Convergent validity</strong>: The classic strategy for showing validity is to show that a measure relates (usually, correlates) with other putative measures of the same construct. When these relationships are measured concurrently, this is sometimes called <strong>concurrent validity</strong>. This evidence is most convincing when the other measures themselves have validity evidence.<label for="tufte-sn-133" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">133</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-133" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">133</span> This idea of convergent validity is precisely the circularity of Cronbach and Meehl’s “nomological network” idea – a measure is valid if it relates to other valid measures, which themselves are only valid if the first one is! The measures are valid because the theory works, and the theory works because the measures are valid.</span></li>
<li><strong>Predictive validity</strong>. If the measure predicts other later measures of the construct; often used in lifespan and developmental studies where it is particularly prized for a measure to be able to predict meaningful life outcomes in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Divergent validity</strong>. If the measure can be shown to be distinct from measure(s) of a different construct, this evidence can help establish that the measure is specifically linked to the target construct.</li>
</ul>
<div id="validity-arguments-in-practice" class="section level3" number="8.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.2.1</span> Validity arguments in practice</h3>
<p>Let’s take a look at how we might make an argument about the validity of the CDI, the vocabulary instrument that we used for our case study.</p>
<p>First, the CDI is face valid – it is clearly about early language ability. In contrast, even though a child’s height would likely be correlated with their early language ability, we should be skeptical of this measure due to its lack of face validity. In addition, the CDI shows good concurrent and predictive validity. Concurrently, the CDI correlates well with evidence from transcripts of children’s actual speech and from standardized language assessments (as discussed in the case study above). And predictively, CDI scores at age 2 actually relate to reading scores during elementary school <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-marchman2008" role="doc-biblioref">Marchman and Fernald 2008</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, users of the CDI must avoid challenges to the internal validity of the data they collect. For example, some CDI data are compromised by confusing instructions or poor data collection processes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-frank2021" role="doc-biblioref">Frank et al. 2021</a>)</span>. Further, advocates and critics of the CDI argue about its ecological validity. There is something quite ecologically valid about asking parents and caregivers – who are experts on their own child – to report on their child’s abilities. On the other hand, the actual experience of filling out a structured form estimating language ability might be more familiar to some families from high education backgrounds than it would be for others from lower education backgrounds. Thus, a critic could reasonably say that comparisons of CDI scores across socioeconomic strata would be an invalid usage.</p>

<p>One big issue to be careful about is that researchers have been known to modify their scales and their scale scoring practices (say, omitting items from a survey or rescaling responses) after data collection. This kind of post-hoc alteration of the measurement instrument can sometimes be justified by features of the data, but it can also look a lot like <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-hacking! If researchers modify their measurement strategy after seeing their data, this decision needs to be disclosed, and it may undermine their statistical inferences.</p>

<div id="how-to-select-a-good-measure" class="section level2" number="8.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> How to select a good measure?</h2>
<p>Ideally you want a measure that is reliable and valid. How do you get one? An important first principle is to use a pre-existing measure. Perhaps someone else has done the hard work of compiling evidence on reliability and validity, and in that case you will most likely want to piggyback on that work. Standardized measures are typically broad in their application and so the tendency can be to discard these because they are not tailored for our studies specifically. But the benefits of a standardized measure are substantial. Not only can you justify the measure using the prior literature, you also have an important index of population variability by comparing absolute scores to other reports.<label for="tufte-sn-134" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">134</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-134" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">134</span> Comparing absolute measurements is a really important trick for “sanity-checking” your data. If your participants are way less accurate than the ones in the paper you’re following up, that may be a signal that something has gone wrong.</span></p>
<p>If you don’t use someone else’s measure, you’ll need to make one up yourself. Most experimenters go down this route at some point, but if you do, remember that you will need to figure out how to estimate its reliability and also how to make an argument for its validity!</p>
<p>We can assign numbers to almost anything people do. We could run an experiment on children’s exploratory play and count the number of times they interact with another child <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ross1989" role="doc-biblioref">H. S. Ross and Lollis 1989</a>)</span>, or run an experiment on aggression where we quantify the amount of hot sauce participants serve <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lieberman1999" role="doc-biblioref">Lieberman et al. 1999</a>)</span>. Yet most of the time we choose a relatively small set of operational variables: asking survey questions, collecting choices and reaction times, and measuring physiological variables like eye-movements. Besides following these conventions, how do we choose the right measurement type for a particular experiment?</p>
<p>There’s no hard and fast rule about what aspect of behavior to measure, but here we will focus on two dimensions that can help us organize the broad space of possible measure targets.<label for="tufte-sn-135" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">135</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-135" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">135</span> Some authors differentiate between “self-report” and “observational” measures. This distinction seems simple on its face, but actually gets kind of complicated. Is a facial expression a “self-report”? Language is not the only way that people communicate with one another – many actions are intended to be communicative <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-shafto2012" role="doc-biblioref">Shafto, Goodman, and Frank 2012</a>)</span>.</span> The first of these is the continuum between simple and complex behaviors. The second is the focus on explicit, voluntary behaviors vs. implicit or involuntary behaviors.</p>

Figure 8.8: Often choosing a measure can be consolidated into a choice along a continuum from simple measures that provide a small amount of information but are quick and easy to repeat and those that provide much richer information but require more time.
</span>
</p>
<p>Figure <a href="8-measurement.html#fig:measurement-considerations">8.8</a> shows the continuum between simple and complex behaviors. The simplest measurable behaviors tend to be button presses, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>pressing a key to advance to the next word in a word-by-word self-paced reading study</li>
<li>selecting “yes” or “no” in a lexical decision task</li>
<li>making a forced choice between different alternatives to indicate which has been seen before</li>
</ul>
<p>These specific measures – and many more like them – are the bread and butter of many cognitive psychology studies. Because they are quick and easy to explain, these tasks can be repeated over many trials. They can also be executed with a wider variety of populations including with young children and sometimes even with non-human animals with appropriate adaptation. (A further benefit of these paradigms is that they can yield useful reaction time data, which we discuss further below).</p>
<p>In contrast, a huge range of complex behaviors have been studied by psychologists, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>open-ended verbal interviews</li>
<li>written expression, e.g. via handwriting or writing style</li>
<li>body movements, including gestures, walking, or dance</li>
<li>drawing or artifact building</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many reasons to study these kinds of behaviors. First, the behaviors themselves may be examples of tasks of interest (e.g., studies of drawing that seek to understand the origins of artistic expression). Or, the behavior may stand in for other even more complex behaviors of interest, as in studies of typing that use this behavior as a proxy for lexical knowledge <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rumelhart1982" role="doc-biblioref">Rumelhart and Norman 1982</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Complex behaviors typically afford a huge variety of different measurement strategies. So any experiment that uses a particular measurement of a complex behavior will typically need to do significant work up front to justify the choice of that measurement strategy – how to quantify dances or gestures or typing errors – and provide some assurance about its reliability. Further, it is often much more difficult to have a participant repeat a complex behavior many times under the same conditions. Imagine asking someone to draw hundreds of sketches as opposed to pressing a key hundreds of times! Thus, the choice of a complex behavior is often a choice to forego a large number of simple trials for a small number of more complex trials.</p>
<p>Complex behaviors can be especially useful to study either at the beginning or the end of a set of experiments. At the beginning of a set of experiments, they can provide inspiration about the richness of the target behavior and insight into the many factors that influence it. And at the end of a set of experiments, they can provide an ecologically valid measure to complement a reliable but more artificial, lab-based behavior.</p>
<p>The more complex the behavior, however, the more it will vary across individuals and the more environmental and situational factors will affect it. These can be important parts of the phenomenon, but they will also be nuisances that are difficult to get under experimental control. Simple measures are typically easier to use and hence easier to deploy repeatedly in a set of experiments where you iterate your manipulation to test a causal theory.</p>
</div>
<div id="implicit-vs.-explicit-behaviors" class="section level3" number="8.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.3.2</span> Implicit vs. explicit behaviors</h3>
<p>A second important dimension of organization for measures is the difference between implicit and explicit measures. An explicit measure provides a measurement of a behavior that a participant has conscious awareness of – for example, the answer to a question. In contrast, implicit measures provide measurements of psychological processes that participants are unable to report (or occasionally, unwilling to).<label for="tufte-sn-136" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">136</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-136" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">136</span> Implicit/explicit is likely more of a continuum, but one cut-point is whether the participants’ behavior is considered intentional: that is, participants <em>intend</em> to press a key to register a decision, but they likely do not intend to react in 300 as opposed to 350 milliseconds due to having seen a prime.</span> Implicit measures, especially reaction time, have long been argued to reflect internal psychological processes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-donders1969" role="doc-biblioref">Donders 1868/1969</a>)</span>. They also have been proposed as measures of qualities such as racial bias that participants may have motivation not to disclose <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-greenwald1998" role="doc-biblioref">Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz 1998</a>)</span>.
There are also of course a host of physiological measurements available. Some of these measure eye-movements, heart rate, or skin conductance, which can be linked to aspects of cognitive process. Others reflect underlying brain activity via the signals associated with MRI, MEG, NIRS, and EEG measurements. These methods are outside the scope of this book, though we note that the measurement concerns we discuss here are entirely germane <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-zuo2019" role="doc-biblioref">Zuo, Xu, and Milham 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Many tasks produce both accuracy and reaction time data. Often these trade off with one another in a classic <strong>speed-accuracy tradeoff</strong>: the faster participants respond, the less accurate they are. For example, to investigate racial bias in policing, <span class="citation">Payne (<a href="#ref-payne2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> showed US college students a series of pictures of tools and guns, proceeded by a prime of either a White face or a Black face. In a first study, participants were faster to identify weapons when primed by a Black face but had similar accuracies. A second study added a response deadline to speed up judgments: this manipulation resulted in equal reaction times across conditions but greater errors in weapon identification after Black prime faces. These studies likely revealed the same phenomenon – some sort of bias to associate Black faces with weapons – but the design of the task moved participants along a speed accuracy tradeoff, yielding effects on different measures.<label for="tufte-sn-137" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">137</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-137" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">137</span> One way of describing the information processing underlying this tradeoff is given by drift diffusion models, which allow joint analysis of accuracy and reaction time <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-voss2013" role="doc-biblioref">Voss, Nagler, and Lerche 2013</a>)</span>. Used appropriately, drift diffusion models can provide a way to remove speed-accuracy tradeoffs and extract more reliable signals from tasks where accuracy and reaction time are both measured (see <span class="citation">Johnson et al. (<a href="#ref-johnson2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> for an example of DDM on a weapon-decision task).</span></p>
<p>Simple, explicit behaviors are often a good starting point. Work using these measures – often the least ecologically valid – can then be enriched with implicit measures or measurements of more complex behaviors.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.4</span> The temptation to measure lots of things</h2>
<p>If one measure is good, shouldn’t two be better? Many experimenters add multiple measurements to their experiments, reasoning that more data is better than less. But that’s not always true!</p>
<p>The decision whether to include multiple measures is an aesthetic and practical issue as well as a scientific one. Throughout this book we have been advocating for a viewpoint in which experiments should be as simple as possible. For us, the best experiment is one that shows that a simple and valid manipulation affects a single, reliable and valid measure.<label for="tufte-sn-138" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">138</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-138" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">138</span> In an entertaining article called “things I have learned (so far)”, <span class="citation">Cohen (<a href="#ref-cohen1990" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span> quips that he leans so far in the direction of large numbers of observations and small numbers of measures, that some students think his perfect study has 10,000 participants and no measures.</span> If you are tempted to include more than one measure, see if we can talk you out of it.<label for="tufte-sn-139" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">139</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-139" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">139</span> As usual, we want to qualify that we are only talking about randomized experiments here! In observational studies, often the point is to measure the associations between multiple measures so you typically <em>have</em> to include more than one. Additionally, some of the authors of this book have advocated for measuring multiple outcomes in longitudinal observational studies, which could reduce investigator bias, encourage reporting null effects, enable comparison of effect sizes, and improve research efficiency <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vanderweele2020outcome" role="doc-biblioref">VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020</a>)</span>. We’ve also done plenty of descriptive studies – these can be very valuable. In a descriptive context, often the goal is to include as many measures as possible so as to have a holistic picture of the phenomenon of interest.</span></p>
<p>First, make sure that including more measures doesn’t compromise each individual measure. This can happen via fatigue or carryover effects. For example, if a brief attitude induction is followed by multiple questionnaire measures, it is a good bet that there is likely to be “fade-out” of the effect over time, so it won’t have the same effect on the first questionnaire as the last one. Further, even if a condition manipulation has a long duration effect on participants, survey fatigue may lead to less meaningful responses to later questions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-herzog1981" role="doc-biblioref">Herzog and Bachman 1981</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Second, consider whether you have a strong prediction for each measure, or whether you are simply looking for more ways to see an effect of your manipulation. As we’ve discussed in Chapter <a href="2-theories.html#theories">2</a>, we think of an experiment as a “bet.” On that viewpoint, theories are best tested by observing measurements that they predict but that are low probability according to others. The more measures you add, the more bets you are making but the less value you are putting on each. In essence, you are hedging your bets and so the success of any one bet is less convincing.</p>
<p>Third, if you include multiple measures in your experiment, you need to think about how you will interpret inconsistent results. Imagine you have experimental participants engage in a brief written reflection that is hypothesized to affect a construct (vs a control writing exercise, say listing meals). If you include two measures of the construct of interest and one shows a larger effect, what will you conclude? It may be tempting to assume that the one that shows a larger effect is the “better measure” but the logic is circular – it’s only better if the manipulation affected the construct of interest, which is what you were testing in the first place! Including multiple measures because you’re uncertain which one is more related to the construct indulges in this circular logic, since the experiment often can’t resolve the situation. A much better move in this case is to do a preliminary study of the reliability and validity of the two measures so as to be able to select one as the experiment’s primary endpoint.</p>
<p>Finally, if you do include multiple measures, selective reporting of significant or hypothesis-aligned measures becomes a real risk. For this reason, preregistration and transparent reporting of all measures becomes even more important.</p>
<p>There are some cases where more measures are better. The more expensive the experiment, the less likely it is to be repeated to gather a new measurement of the effects of the same manipulation. Thus, larger studies present a stronger rationale for including multiple measures. Clinical trials often involve interventions that can have effects on many different measures; imagine a cancer treatment that might affect mortality rates, quality of life, tumor growth rates, etc. Further, such trials are extremely expensive and difficult to repeat. Thus, there is a strong rationale for including more measures in such studies.</p>

<div id="chapter-summary-measurement" class="section level2" number="8.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.5</span> Chapter summary: Measurement</h2>
<p>In olden times, all the psychologists went to the same conferences and worried about the same things. But then a split formed between different groups. Educational psychologists and psychometricians thought a lot about how different problems on tests had different measurement properties. They began exploring how to select good and bad items, and how to figure out people’s ability abstracted away from specific items. This led to a profusion of interesting ideas about measurement and modeling, but these ideas rarely percolated into day-to-day practice in other areas.
For example, cognitive psychologists collected lots of trials and measured quantities of interest with high precision, but worried less about measure validity or experimental reliability.
Social psychologists spent more time worrying about issues of ecological validity in their experiments, but often used <em>ad hoc</em> scales with poor psychometric properties.</p>
<p>These sociological differences between fields has led to an unfortunate divergence, where experimentalists often do not recognize the value of the conceptual tools developed to aid measurement, and hence fail to reason about the reliability and validity of their measures in ways that can help them make better inferences. The fundamental insight of the psychometric perspective is that the constructs we study as psychologists are latent, rather than directly observed. So when we attempt to measure these constructs, we need to understand the properties of our instruments and how we hypothesize that they connect to the constructs of interest. As we said in our discussion of reliability, ignorance is not bliss. Even if you fail to make explicit assumptions about how your measure functions and how it connects to your construct of interest, your adoption of defaults still constitutes a choice. Much better to think these choices through!</p>
