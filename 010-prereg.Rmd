# Preregistration

::: {.learning-goals}
🍎 Learning goals: Discuss why preregistration increases the value of research; select and use a preregistration platform; consider preregistration as a transparency step; contextualize preregistration along with other tools for decreasing overfitting.

Why preregister? (Hardwicke and Wagenmakers 2021)

- Reduce bias – addresses the problem of researcher degrees of freedom and selective reporting.
- Calibrate confidence – helps to gauge risk of bias thereby enabling proper interpretation of confirmatory vs exploratory results.
- Increase transparency – it’s not a straightjacket that prevents you from doing anything else, it’s a snapshot of your current thinking
- Front-load careful thinking – forces you to sit down and be careful about your thinking, often catch conceptual issues and save time in the long-run

How to preregister

- Intro to Open Science Framework as one tool for timestamping your hypotheses, different kinds of preregistration templates.

Reporting preregistered work – distinguishing exploratory and confirmatory analyses, acknowledging departures from original plan

Preregistration of secondary data analysis (and caveats about causal inference). Not our main topic, but important. 

Barriers to adoption of preregistration. 

Limitations of the preregistration approach, especially with respect to iterative theory building (e.g., Navarro critique).

From reviewer: "A mention of what preregistration is not meant for. When teaching preregistration to new graduate students or undergraduates, I find that students often get hung up on trying to “guess” the outcome of their experiment correctly, even when they have little theoretical or empirical background for their predictions. Preregistration isn’t about testing our precognition skills, though, so I find it helpful to address this issue early on."
