<p>🔬 Case study: Hotel towel reuse (Scheibehenne, Jamil, and Wagenmakers 2016). A simple example of aggregating noisy evidence from replications.</p>
<p>In a widely-cited study on the power of describing social norms, Goldstein, Cialdini, and Griskevicius (2008) gave one group of hotel guests a message that encouraged them to reuse their towels and another group of hotel guests a message that indicated that most other guests reused their towels. Across two studies, they found that guests who received the social norm message were more likely to reuse their towels than guests who received the control message (Study 1 <span class="math inline">\(p = .05\)</span>, Study 2 <span class="math inline">\(p = .03\)</span>). Five later replications, though, all failed to find significant evidence of increases in towel reuse among guests receiving the social norm message (all <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; .05\)</span>).</p>
<p>At first glance, you might conclude that the effect of social norm messages does not reliably impact towel reuse. You might even go a step further and try to think of explanations for why one team found the effect, but the other did not. Maybe the messages change behavior when guest receive nice fluffy towels, but doesn’t work when guests receive cheap, low-quality towels.
<!-- Or, if you're a practitioner of experimentology, you may quantitatively synthesize the evidence via meta-analysis! --></p>
<p>This case is one where binary thinking is not helpful. If you synthesized the evidence via a meta-analysis, you would find that the results across these studies are, for the most part, quite consistent. Guests in four out of five of the studies were more likely to reuse their towels after receiving social norm messages, but the difference was not large enough in most studies to confidently conclude that this difference was larger than zero. When the results were statistically combined however, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-scheibehenne2016" role="doc-biblioref">Scheibehenne et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-scheibehenne2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> found that social norm messages did <em>on average</em> did increase hotel towel reuse.</p>
</div>
<p>What distinguishes meta-analysis from other types of reviews? Literature review typology, organized by your search, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis strategy (Grant and Booth 2009).</p>
<p>When many students hear the term “review,” they probably have flashbacks to a time where they threw some search term into Google Scholar, downloaded a bunch of articles that looked interesting, spent a few hours reading those articles, and then wrote a summary of what has been learned from these studies. There’s not necessarily anything wrong with this approach, but there are a few things that can be additionally learned from doing a meta-analysis.</p>
<p>Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for combining results from multiple studies.</p>
<p>In addition to reading articles, a researcher performing a meta-analysis would also extract information about the <em>effect size</em>.</p>
<p>After this information has been extracted, the researcher would perform an analysis where these effect sizes are combined in a single set of analyses. By combining information from multiple studies, the researcher can make a more precise estimate of the size of some effect. The researcher can also look at the extent to which this effect varies across studies. They may even them perform analyses indicating whether studies with certain characteristics systematically produce different results.</p>
<p>Think about how meta-analysis might give you a different impression of an area of study than a literature review. If you would have performed a literature review on studies examining the effect of social norm messaging on hotel towel re-use, you would have likely come away with the impression that there is an unreliable effect at best and no effect at worst. However, when statistically combining the results of these studies, a meta-analyst is able to see that the findings are more consistent than they appear at first glance–and that, when considering all the available evidence, it actually appears that social norm messaging does decrease hotel towel reuse. Considering that, for example, there were 1.7 billion overnight hotel bookings in the European Union alone in 2013 (Eurostat, 2015), the difference in the types of the conclusions formed by a literature review and a meta-analysis matter quite a bit!</p>
<p>The towel example is a good starting point but there is much more we can do with meta-analysis for a larger literature. So we’ll now turn to a different running example. For more than a century, social scientists have sought to understand and mitigate prejudice. One influential idea, the <em>contact hypothesis</em>, posits that prejudice “may be reduced by equal status contact between majority and minority groups in the pursuit of common goals” (Allport, 1954, p. 281). In a recent meta-analysis, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-paluck2019contact" role="doc-biblioref">Paluck et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-paluck2019contact" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> examined whether randomly-assigned contact interventions had long-term effects on prejudice-related outcomes. We use this meta-analysis throughout this chapter to highlight how various meta-analytic tools have provided invaluable insights about this important question.</p>

<div id="how-not-to-synthesize-evidence" class="section level3" number="17.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.1.1</span> How <em>not</em> to synthesize evidence</h3>
<p>When considering evidence across multiple studies, what most of us do intuitively is simply to count how many studies supported the hypothesis under investigation, versus how many did not support the hypothesis. Such a count usually amounts to counting the number of studies with “significant” <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values, since (for better or for worse) “significance” is largely what drives studies’ take-home conclusions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mcshane2017statistical" role="doc-biblioref">McShane &amp; Gal, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-nelson1986interpretation" role="doc-biblioref">N. Nelson et al., 1986</a>)</span>. This is called “<strong>vote-counting</strong>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-borenstein2021introduction" role="doc-biblioref">Borenstein et al., 2021</a>)</span>. For example, in Paluck et al.’s meta-analysis 11 of 27 (EYEBALLED) studies were significant, all with positive point estimates. So, based on this vote-count, we would have the impression that most studies do not support the contact hypothesis.<label for="tufte-sn-128" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">128</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-128" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">128</span> Many narrative reviews take essentially this vote-counting approach, albeit often not explicitly. If you see this kind of practice, your first instinct should be to say “why is there no quantitative meta-analysis?”</span></p>
<p>Despite its intuitive appeal, vote-counting can be very misleading because this approach characterizes evidence solely in terms of dichotomized <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values, while entirely ignoring effect sizes. In Chapter <a href="2-replication.html#replication">2</a>, we saw how this fetishism of statistical significance can mislead us when we consider individual studies. These problems propagate if we vote-count statistical significance across studies as well. For example, it could be the case that relatively few studies are significant (for example, in a literature of typically small studies), yet if the studies typically have large point estimates, then the consensus of evidence could actually be quite strong. Or inversely, it could be that nearly all studies are significant, but if they typically have small point estimates, then the consensus of evidence might still be rather weak. In these cases, vote-counting could lead us badly astray <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-borenstein2021introduction" role="doc-biblioref">Borenstein et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>To avoid these pitfalls, a principled evidence synthesis needs to account for effect sizes themselves. How about if we just average the studies’ estimates? For example, in Paluck et al.’s meta-analysis, the mean of the studies’ estimates is XXX. This approach is perhaps a step in the right direction, but still has some important limitations. In particular, this approach gives equal weight to each study, such that a small study (like Hull et al., with a sample size of XXX [note: this had the second-smallest RE weight]) contributes as much to the mean effect size as a large study (like Boisjoly et al., with a sample size of XXX [note: this had the highest RE weight]). That doesn’t make sense: larger studies should clearly carry more weight in the analysis. This brings us to our first principled approach to meta-analysis, namely fixed-effects meta-analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="combining-results-across-studies-using-fixed-effects-meta-analysis" class="section level3" number="17.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.1.2</span> Combining results across studies using fixed-effects meta-analysis</h3>
<p>Fixed-effects meta-analysis is a simple way to average studies’ estimates while giving more weight to larger studies. Specifically, fixed-effects meta-analysis is a weighted average in which each study’s estimate is weighted by its inverse-variance (i.e., the inverse of its squared standard error). This makes sense because larger, more precise studies have smaller variances, so they should get more weight in the analysis. The fixed-effects pooled estimate is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\widehat{\mu} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \widehat{\theta}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of studies, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}_i\)</span> is the point estimate of the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> study, and <span class="math inline">\(w_i = 1/\widehat{\sigma}^2_i\)</span> is study <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s weight in the analysis (i.e., the inverse of its variance).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Do we want to show the SE for <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span>?] NC: I am conflicted about this. On one hand, it seems odd that we don’t give any information about how one would perform a hypothesis test with the overall effect size estimate. On the other hand, I don’t want to scare people with too many equations. Maybe we can address this concern by explaining in simple language what the equations are doing and then putting the actual equation in the margin?</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- ### Applied example -->
<p>In Paluck et al.’s meta-analysis, we would calculate the fixed-effects estimate, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span>, as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[SHOW ARITHMETIC FOR THE FIRST FEW STUDIES].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We thus estimate that the effect size in this studies is a standardized mean difference of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu} = XXX\)</span>; 95% confidence interval: [XXX]; <span class="math inline">\(p=\)</span>XXX. That is, we estimated that intergroup contact was associated with a decrease in prejudice of XXX standard deviations.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations-of-fixed-effects-meta-analysis" class="section level3" number="17.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.1.3</span> Limitations of fixed-effects meta-analysis</h3>
<p>Fixed-effects meta-analysis does have important limitations. To see this intuitively, imagine we actually had the full dataset of individual observations from each study. (This is what meta-analysts dream of, but it’s rarely feasible in practice.) Fixed-effects meta-analysis is like simply concatenating all the studies’ datasets and then calculating the effect size, ignoring that observations came from different studies.</p>
<p>But what if the studies differ from one another? For example, in Paluck et al.’s meta-analysis, many design elements differed in ways that could make the interventions more or less effective in different studies: some studies recruited adult participants while others recruited children, some studies considered contact between participants of different races while others considered contact between participants of different ages, and so on. This means that the contact effect could actually differ across studies: the effects could be <strong>heterogeneous</strong>.</p>
<p>Does this presence of heterogeneity remind you of anything from when we analyzed repeated-measures data in Chapter <a href="6-models.html#models">6</a> on models? Recall that, with repeated-measures data, we had dealt with the possibility of heterogeneity across participants by introducing random intercepts by participant to our regression model. We can do much the same thing in meta-analysis; let’s turn to this now.</p>
</div>
<div id="random-effects-meta-analysis" class="section level3" number="17.1.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.1.4</span> Random-effects meta-analysis</h3>
<p>Whereas fixed-effects meta-analysis essentially postulates that all studies in the meta-analysis have the same population effect size, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, random-effects meta-analysis instead postulates that studies’ population effects come from a normal distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-129" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">129</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-129" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">129</span> Technically, other specifications of random-effects meta-analysis are possible. For example, robust variance estimation does not require making assumptions about the distribution of effects across studies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hedges2010robust" role="doc-biblioref">Hedges et al., 2010</a>)</span>. These approaches also have other substantial advantages, like their ability to handle effects that are clustered [e.g., because some papers contribute multiple estimates; <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-hedges2010robust" role="doc-biblioref">Hedges et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-hedges2010robust" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>; <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-pustejovsky2021meta" role="doc-biblioref">Pustejovsky &amp; Tipton</a> (<a href="#ref-pustejovsky2021meta" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>] and their ability to provide better inference in meta-analyses with relatively few studies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tipton2015small" role="doc-biblioref">Tipton, 2015</a>)</span>. For these reasons, we tend to use these methods by default when conducting meta-analyses.</span> The larger the standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, the more heterogeneous the effects are across studies. A random-effects model then estimates both <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, for example by maximum likelihood (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-dersimonian1986meta" role="doc-biblioref">DerSimonian &amp; Laird</a> (<a href="#ref-dersimonian1986meta" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>)</span>; <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-brockwell2001comparison" role="doc-biblioref">Brockwell &amp; Gordon</a> (<a href="#ref-brockwell2001comparison" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>The resulting estimate <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span> is still a weighted average of studies’ estimates, as for fixed-effects meta-analysis:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\widehat{\mu} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \widehat{\theta}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}\]</span> but the inverse-variance weights now incorporate the heterogeneity as well: <span class="math inline">\(w_i = 1/\left(\widehat{\tau}^2 + \widehat{\sigma}^2_i \right)\)</span>. These weights represent the inverse of studies’ <em>marginal</em> variances, comprising not only statistical error due to their finite sample sizes (<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\sigma}^2_i\)</span>) but also genuine effect heterogeneity (<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\tau}^2\)</span>).<label for="tufte-sn-130" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">130</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-130" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">130</span> The estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\tau}^2\)</span> is a bit more complicated, but is essentially a weighted average of studies’ residuals, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta_i} - \widehat{\mu}\)</span>, while subtracting away variation due to statistical error, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\sigma}^2_i\)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brockwell2001comparison" role="doc-biblioref">Brockwell &amp; Gordon, 2001</a>; <a href="#ref-dersimonian1986meta" role="doc-biblioref">DerSimonian &amp; Laird, 1986</a>)</span>.</span></p>
<p>The upshot is that small studies contribute more strongly to a random-effects meta-analysis (i.e., they have larger weights) than they do to a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Additionally, confidence intervals are typically wider in random-effects meta-analysis than in fixed-effects meta-analysis; heuristically, this is because random-effects meta-analysis has to draw inference to a distribution of heterogeneous effects rather than to only one population effect that is shared by all studies.</p>
<!-- ### Reporting on heterogeneity -->
<p>Remember that in random-effects meta-analysis, the estimate <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span> represents only the <em>mean</em> population effect across studies.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.2</span> Bias in meta-analysis</h2>
<p>Meta-analysis is an invaluable tool to synthesize evidence across studies. However, meta-analyses can be compromised by two categories of bias: <strong>within-study biases</strong> and <strong>across-study biases</strong>. Either type of bias can lead to meta-analysis estimates that are too large, too small, or in the wrong direction. We will now discuss examples of each type of bias. We will also discuss ways to address these biases when conducting a meta-analysis, including mitigating the biases at the outset through sound meta-analysis design and also assessing the robustness of the ultimate conclusions to possible remaining bias.</p>
<div class="accident-report">
<p>⚠️ Quick draft of accident report: Garbage in, garbage out? Meta-analyzing bad research (Coles et al. 2019)</p>
<p>You may have heard that Botox can help eliminate wrinkles. But some researchers have also suggested that it may help treat clinical depression when used to paralyze the muscles associated with frowning. As crazy as they may sound, a quick examination of the literature would lead many to conclude that this treatment works. Studies that randomly assign depressed patients to either receive Botox injections or saline injections do indeed find that Botox recipients exhibit decreases in depression. And when you combine all available evidence in a meta-analysis, you find that this difference is quite large: <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu} = 0.83\)</span>, 95% CI [0.52, 1.14].</p>
<p>However, Coles and colleagues (2019) pointed out that there is a problem with within-study bias. Participants are not supposed to know whether they have been randomly assigned to receive Botox or a control saline injections. However, only one of these treatments leads the upper half of your face to be paralyzed, and after a couple of weeks you’re likely to figure out whether you received the treatment or control injection. Thus, it is possible that the apparent effect of Botox is actually an effect of placebo. The meta-analytic conclusions are potentially undermined by within-study bias.</p>
<p>Coles and colleagues (2019) also found evidence of between-study bias. When coding the effect sizes in the literature, they found that 51% of the outcomes measured were not reported by the study authors. For example, researchers may have collected two measures of depression, but only reported one in the manuscript. This raises concerns about selective reporting: that researchers examining the effects of Botox on depression are only reporting the outcomes that demonstrate an effect, while hiding away the outcomes that do not. In this scenario, any meta-analytic conclusions are potentially undermined by between-study bias.</p>
<p>This is sometimes called the Garbage In, Garbage Out problem in meta-analysis. If within- and between-study bias is not properly mitigated, it is difficult to conclude make valid inferences in a meta-analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="within-study-biases" class="section level3" number="17.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.2.1</span> Within-study biases</h3>
<p>Within-study biases affect the internal validity of the meta-analyzed studies’ internal validity (Chapter XXX; [use examples of types of bias that were discussed earlier]).
These within-study biases can propagate to the results of the meta-analysis. For example, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-paluck2019contact" role="doc-biblioref">Paluck et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-paluck2019contact" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> note that early studies on intergroup contact almost exclusively used nonrandomized designs. Imagine a bias-prone study in which participants were not randomly assigned to receive an intergroup contact intervention, but instead, the participants who already had the least prejudice at baseline were also the most likely to opt into receiving the contact intervention. In that case, baseline prejudice could confound the relationship between contact interventions and subsequent prejudice, perhaps resulting in a spuriously inflated estimate. Now, if many or all studies in a meta-analysis are subject to this same form of bias, the meta-analysis might arrive at an impressively large and precise pooled estimate, yet this estimate itself could be badly biased. Garbage in, garbage out!</p>
<p>To mitigate this problem, meta-analysts should try to define study eligibility criteria that reduce within-study biases (for example, by excluding nonrandomized studies when confounding is of concern, as <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-paluck2019contact" role="doc-biblioref">Paluck et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-paluck2019contact" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> did). After data have been collected, meta-analysts should also qualitatively assess studies’ risks of bias using established rating tools <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-art" role="doc-biblioref">Mathur &amp; VanderWeele, 2022</a>)</span>. Additionally, it is often informative to conduct statistical sensitivity analyses that help characterize how sensitive meta-analysis results may be to residual bias that cannot be eliminated by limiting study eligibility <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-art" role="doc-biblioref">Mathur &amp; VanderWeele, 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<!-- ### Applied example -->
<p>In Paluck et al.’s meta-analysis, one way they tried to counteract within-study biases was by only including studies that randomly assigned participants to receive a contact intervention. However, they could have gone a step further by coding for the extent to which, for example, participants may have differentially dropped out of the study. For example, imagine that (a) both a contact intervention and control condition have an equal distribution of prejudice scores and (b) the contact intervention does not significantly impact prejudice. If highly prejudiced people are more likely to drop out of the study when they are in the contact vs. control condition (e.g., because they do not like interacting with a member of a minority group), the mean of the contact intervention will become smaller. In this scenario, researchers may erroneously conclude that the contact intervention reduced depression, despite the fact that the effect can be attributed to differential attrition.</p>
</div>
<div id="across-study-biases" class="section level3" number="17.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.2.2</span> Across-study biases</h3>
<p>Across-study biases affect the meta-analyzed literature holistically and include, for example, publication bias and selective reporting, as discussed in Chapter XXX. Often, these across-study biases favor statistically significant positive results; in this case, results that survive to publication and inclusion in the meta-analysis will typically have inflated estimates (they are too large compared to the truth) and so result in an inflated meta-analytic estimate.</p>
<div class="accident-report">
<p>🔬 Accident Report: Quantifying publication bias in the social sciences</p>
<p>In 2014, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-franco2014" role="doc-biblioref">Franco et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-franco2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> and colleagues examined the population of 221 studies conducted through a funding initiative that helps researchers run experiments on nationally-representative samples in the U.S.. First, Franco and colleagues examined the records of these studies to determine whether the researchers found statistically significant results, a mixture of statistically significant and nonsignificant results, or only nonsignificant results. Then, Franco and colleagues examined the likelihood that these results were published in the scientific literature.</p>
<p>What results do you think were lease likely to be published? If you guessed “nonsignificant results” you are correct. Less than 25% of studies that produced only statistically non-significant results were published in the scientific literature, compared to over 60% of studies that produced statistically significant results. These results are consistent with fears about publication bias: that studies yielding non-significant results are less likely to be published than those that produce significant results.</p>
</div>
<p>As in the context of within-study biases, meta-analysts should try to mitigate across-study biases during the design process. That is, meta-analysis inclusion criteria should be designed to cast a broad net, capturing not only high-profile, published studies on the topic, but also studies published in low-profile journals, and “gray literature” such as unpublished dissertations and theses (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-lefebvre2019searching" role="doc-biblioref">Lefebvre et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-lefebvre2019searching" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>].<label for="tufte-sn-132" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">132</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-132" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">132</span> However, evidence is mixed regarding whether including gray literature actually reduces across-study biases in meta-analysis <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sapbe" role="doc-biblioref">Mathur &amp; VanderWeele, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-tsuji2020addressing" role="doc-biblioref">Tsuji et al., 2020</a>)</span>.</span> A broad search will also help capture not only studies in which the analysis that is relevant to the meta-analysis was primary “headline” finding, but also studies that reported the relevant analysis only as a secondary or supplemental result.</p>
<p>There are also statistical methods to help assess how robust the results may be to across-study biases. Among the most popular tools to assess and correct for publication bias is the <strong>funnel plot</strong> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-duval2000trim" role="doc-biblioref">Duval &amp; Tweedie, 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-egger1997bias" role="doc-biblioref">Egger et al., 1997</a>)</span>, a graph relating the meta-analyzed studies’ point estimates to some measure of their precision, such as sample size or standard error. Here is an example of a funnel plot for a hypothetical meta-analysis with no publication bias:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Insert generic funnel plot]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that larger studies (those with smaller standard errors) cluster more closely around the mean than do smaller studies, but large and small studies alike would have point estimates centered around the mean. That is, the funnel plot is symmetric. In contrast, a funnel plot might look asymmetric:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Insert example of asymmetric funnel plot. I think Paluck’s will work, and it’s a great example of asymmetry that could reflect substantive differences between large and small studies.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, there appears to be a correlation between studies’ estimates and their standard errors, such that smaller studies tend to have larger estimates than do larger studies. Such a correlation can indicate the presence of <strong>“small-study effects”</strong>, meaning that effect sizes differ systematically between small and large studies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sterne2011recommendations" role="doc-biblioref">Sterne et al., 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Several popular statistical methods, such as Trim-and-Fill <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-duval2000trim" role="doc-biblioref">Duval &amp; Tweedie, 2000</a>)</span> and Egger’s regression <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-egger1997bias" role="doc-biblioref">Egger et al., 1997</a>)</span> are designed to quantify this type of asymmetry. It is critical to note that small-study effects need not always represent publication bias: they can also reflect genuine substantive differences between small and large studies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-egger1997bias" role="doc-biblioref">Egger et al., 1997</a>; <a href="#ref-lau2006case" role="doc-biblioref">Lau et al., 2006</a>)</span>. For example, in a meta-analysis of intervention studies, if the most effective interventions are also the most expensive or difficult to implement, these highly effective interventions might be used primarily in the smallest studies. Funnel plot methods detect these types of small-study effects as well as certain limited forms of publication bias <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-smt" role="doc-biblioref">Maier et al., 2021</a>)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-133" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">133</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-133" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">133</span> Essentially, funnel plots and most related methods can detect publication bias in which (1) small studies with large positive point estimates are more likely to be published than small studies with small or negative point estimates; and (2) the largest studies are published regardless of the magnitude of their point estimates. Funnel plots may not detect publication bias that favors significant results. For more detail on these points, see <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-smt" role="doc-biblioref">Maier et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-smt" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>.</span></p>
<p>For these reasons, assessments of publication bias in meta-analysis should rely not only on funnel plots <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-smt" role="doc-biblioref">Maier et al., 2021</a>)</span>. There are numerous other methods that can be applied as well, such as <strong>selection models</strong>.<label for="tufte-sn-134" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">134</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-134" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">134</span> High-level overviews of selection models are given in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-mcshane2016adjusting" role="doc-biblioref">McShane et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-mcshane2016adjusting" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-smt" role="doc-biblioref">Maier et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-smt" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. for more methodological detail, see for example <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-hedges1984estimation" role="doc-biblioref">Hedges</a> (<a href="#ref-hedges1984estimation" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-iyengar1988" role="doc-biblioref">Iyengar &amp; Greenhouse</a> (<a href="#ref-iyengar1988" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-vevea1995" role="doc-biblioref">Vevea &amp; Hedges</a> (<a href="#ref-vevea1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>. For a tutorial on fitting and interpreting selection models, see <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-smt" role="doc-biblioref">Maier et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-smt" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>.</span> These models can detect other forms of publication bias that funnel plots may not detect, such as publication bias that favors significant results.</p>
<p>You may also have heard of “<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-methods” to detect across-study biases such as <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-curve and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-uniform <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-van2015meta" role="doc-biblioref">Van Assen et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-van2015meta" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. These methods essentially assess whether the significant <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values “bunch up” just under 0.05, which is taken to indicate publication bias. These methods are increasingly popular in psychology and have merits. However, it is important to note that these methods are actually simplified versions of selection models <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-hedges1984estimation" role="doc-biblioref">Hedges, 1984</a>)</span> that work only under considerably more restrictive settings than do the original selection models [for example, when there is not heterogeneity across studies; <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-mcshane2016adjusting" role="doc-biblioref">McShane et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-mcshane2016adjusting" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>]. For this reason, it is usually (although not always) better to use selection models in place of the more restrictive <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-methods.</p>
<p>In Paluck and colleagues’ meta-analysis, they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used a regression-based approach for publication bias. Found a significant relation between standard error and effect size, which may be driven by publication bias. Used this same regression-based approach to try to correct for publication bias. Effect size was close-to-zero when doing so. Concluded that publication bias is a problem.</li>
<li>Informally compared studies that were pre-registered vs. not pre-registered. Found that the effect size among pre-registered studies is close to zero. Concluded that publication bias is a problem.</li>
</ul>
