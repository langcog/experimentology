<p>This may surprise you coming from the authors of a textbook about research methods, but there is no single “correct” way to design and analyze an experiment<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> Though there are plenty of incorrect ways to design and analyse experiments and we hope we can help you to avoid these!</span>. In fact, for most research decisions, there are many justifiable options. For example, will you stop data collection after 20, 200, or 2000 participants? Will you remove outlier values and how will you define them? Will you conduct subgroup analyses to see whether the results are affected by sex, or age, or some other factor? Consider a simplified, hypothetical case where you need to make five analysis decisions and have five justifiable options for each decision — this alone would result in 3125 (5^5) unique ways to analyze your data! In this chapter, we will find out why undisclosed flexibility in the design, analysis, reporting, and interpretation of experiments (also referred to as “researcher degrees of freedom”), can lead to scientists fooling themselves and fooling each other. We will also learn about how preregistration (and other tools) can be used to protect our research from bias and provide the transparency that other scientists need to properly evaluate and interpret our work.</p>

<p>One way to visualize researcher degrees of freedom is as a vast decision tree or “garden of forking paths” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gelman2014" role="doc-biblioref">Gelman &amp; Loken, 2014</a> Figure <a href="10-prereg.html#fig:forking-paths">10.1</a>)</span>. Each node represents a decision point and each branch represents a justifiable choice. Each unique pathway through the garden terminates in an individual result. Because scientific observations typically consist of both noise (random variation unique to this sample) and signal (regularities that will reoccur in other samples), some of these pathways will inevitably lead to results that are misleading (e.g., inflated effect sizes, exaggerated evidence, or false positives)<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> The signal-to-noise ratio is worse in situations (alas, common in psychology) that involve small effect sizes, high variation, and large measurement errors <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ioannidis2005" role="doc-biblioref">Ioannidis, 2005</a>)</span>. Researcher degrees of freedom may be constrained to some extent by strong theory <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oberauer2019" role="doc-biblioref">Oberauer &amp; Lewandowsky, 2019</a>)</span>, community methodological norms and standards, or replication studies, though these constraints may be more implicit than explicit, and can still leave plenty of room for flexible decision-making.</span>. The more potential paths there are in the garden that you might explore, the higher the chance of encountering misleading results<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> In frequentist terminology, there is an increasing the chance of making a ‘Type I error.’</span>. Statisticians refer to this as a <em>multiplicity</em> problem.</p>
<p>As noted in Chapter <a href="5-inference.html#inference">5</a>, multiplicity can be addressed to some extent with statistical countermeasures, like the Bonferroni correction; however, these adjustment methods need to account for every path that you <em>could have</em> taken <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gelman2014" role="doc-biblioref">Gelman &amp; Loken, 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-degroot2014" role="doc-biblioref">Groot, 2014</a>)</span>. When you navigate the garden of forking paths <em>during data analysis</em>, it is easy to forget, or even be unaware of every path that you could have taken, so these methods can longer be used effectively. Additionally, when a researcher navigates the garden of forking paths during data analysis, their decisions can be biased because they are receiving feedback on how different choices affect the results (<em>results-dependent</em> decision making). If a researcher is seeking a particular kind of result (which is likely - see Box 1), then they are more likely to follow the branches that steer them in that direction. You could think of this a bit like playing a game of “hot🔥! or cold☃️!” where hot🔥! indicates that the choice will move the researcher closer to a desirable overall result and cold☃️! indicates that the choice will move them further away. Each time the researcher reaches a decision point, they try one of the branches and get feedback on how that choice affects the results. If the feedback is hot🔥! then they take that branch. If the answer is cold☃️!, they try a different branch. If they reach the end of a complete pathway, and the results are cold☃️!, maybe they even retrace their steps and try some different branches earlier in the pathway. This strategy create a risk of bias<label for="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">4</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">4</span> We say “risk of bias” rather than just “bias” because in most scientific contexts, we do not have a known ground truth to compare the results to. So in any specific situation, we do not know the extent to which results-dependent analyses have actually biased the results.</span> because the results are being systematically skewed towards the researcher’s preferences<label for="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">5</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">5</span> Another way to think of this is in terms of ‘regression to the mean.’ When a sample statistic is selected because it crosses some threshold (e.g., statistical significance), then it is more likely to provide a biased estimate that decreases upon subsequent measurement.</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hardwicke2021b" role="doc-biblioref">Tom E.

<p>Box 1. Only human: Cognitive biases and skewed incentives</p>
<p>There’s a storybook image of the scientist as an objective, rationale, and dispassionate arbiter of truth <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-veldkamp2017" role="doc-biblioref">Veldkamp et al., 2017</a>)</span>. But in reality, scientists are only human: they have egos, career ambitions, and rent to pay! So even if we do want to live up to the storybook image, its important to acknowledge that our decisions and behaviour are also influenced by a range of cognitive biases and external incentives that can steer us away from that goal. This highlights the need for transparency and intellectual humility <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hoekstra2020" role="doc-biblioref">Hoekstra &amp; Vazire, 2020</a>)</span> when reporting the findings of our research. Let’s first look at some relevant cognitive biases that might lead scientists astray:</p>
<p><strong>Confirmation bias</strong>: Preferentially seeking out, recalling, or evaluating information in a manner that reinforces one’s existing beliefs <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nickerson1998" role="doc-biblioref">Nickerson, 1998</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Hindsight bias</strong>: Believing that past events were always more likely to occur relative to our actual belief in their likelihood before they happened (“I knew it all along!”) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-slovic1977" role="doc-biblioref">Slovic &amp; Fischhoff, 1977</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Motivated reasoning</strong>: Rationalizing prior decisions so they are framed in a favourable light, even if they were irrational <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kunda1990" role="doc-biblioref">Kunda, 1990</a>)</span>.</p>

</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the incentive structure of the scientific ecosystem often adds additional motivation to get things wrong. The allocation of funding, awards, and publication prestige is often based on the nature of research results rather than research quality <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nosek2012" role="doc-biblioref">Nosek et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-smaldino2016" role="doc-biblioref">Smaldino &amp; McElreath, 2016</a>)</span>. For example, many academic journals, especially those that are widely considered to be the most prestigious, appear to have a preference for novel, positive, and ‘statistically significant’ findings over incremental, negative, or null findings <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bakker2012" role="doc-biblioref">Bakker et al., 2012</a>)</span>. There is also pressure to write articles with concise, coherent, and compelling narratives <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-giner-sorolla2012" role="doc-biblioref">Giner-Sorolla, 2012</a>)</span>. This incentivizes scientists to be ‘impressive’ over being right and encourages questionable research practices. The process of iteratively p-hacking and HARKing one’s way to ‘beautiful’ scientific paper has been dubbed “The Chrysalis Effect” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oboyle2017" role="doc-biblioref">O’Boyle et al., 2017</a> Figure <a href="10-prereg.html#fig:chrysalis">10.3</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>In the most egregious cases, a researcher may try multiple pathways until they obtain a desirable result<label for="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">6</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">6</span> “If you torture the data long enough, it will confess” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-good1972" role="doc-biblioref">Good, 1972</a>)</span></span> and then <em>selectively report</em> that result, neglecting to mention that they have tried several other analysis strategies. You may remember an example of this when participants apparently became younger when they listened to “When I’m 64” by The Beatles in Chapter <a href="3-ethics.html#ethics">3</a>. Another nice example is when a group of enterprising researchers were able to ‘discover’ brain activity in a dead Atlantic Salmon by deliberately exploiting flexibility in the fMRI analysis pipeline <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bennett2009" role="doc-biblioref">Bennett et al., 2009</a> Figure <a href="10-prereg.html#fig:salmon">10.4</a>)</span>. Deliberately taking advantage of researcher degrees of freedom and selectively reporting results is known by various names, like p-hacking, cherry picking, data dredging, and it is unethical because it involves hiding highly relevant information. But you should also be aware that results-dependent analysis incurs a risk of bias even if a researcher has good intentions, doesn’t explicitly try multiple pathways, and honestly reports everything they did. For example, if each branch they took was hot🔥!, they may reach the result they desire at the end of the pathway without realizing that, had the results been different, they would have followed other pathways <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gelman2014" role="doc-biblioref">Gelman &amp; Loken, 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-degroot2014" role="doc-biblioref">Groot, 2014</a>)</span>. In other words, even though the researcher doesn’t intend to deliberately hide anything, there is still undisclosed analytic flexibility - important context that is relevant to properly interpret the results. Its surprisingly easy to convince yourself after the fact that you made the decisions you did for principled reasons that had nothing to do with the results (see ‘motivated reasoning,’ Box 1). In sum, engaging in results-dependent analysis increases the chances that you will fool yourself by inadvertently stumbling across misleading results - and if that analytic flexibility goes undisclosed, you may fool others too.</p>

</p>
<p>An important factor that we’ve not yet mentioned in detail, is that there is additional flexibility in how researchers <em>explain</em> research results. Any single result can be consistent with multiple different theories (this is known as the Duhem-Quine problem <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-duhem1954" role="doc-biblioref">Duhem</a> (<a href="#ref-duhem1954" role="doc-biblioref">1954</a>)</span>). We might call these “explanatory degrees of freedom.” The practice of selecting or developing your hypothesis after seeing the study results has been called “Hypotheisizing After the Results are Known,” or “HARKing” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kerr1998" role="doc-biblioref">Kerr, 1998</a>)</span>. HARKing is potentially problematic because it expands the garden of forking paths and helps to justify the use of various analytic degrees of freedom (Figure <a href="10-prereg.html#fig:grid">10.5</a>). For example, you may come up with an explanation for why an intervention is effective in men but not in women in order to justify a post-hoc subgroup analysis based on sex (see Case Study). The extent to which HARKing is problematic is contested <span class="citation">(for discussion see <a href="#ref-hardwicke2021b" role="doc-biblioref">Tom E. Hardwicke &amp; Wagenmakers, 2021</a>)</span>, but we would argue that at the very least its important to be honest about whether hypotheses were developed before or after seeing research results.</p>

<p>But hang on a minute! Isn’t it a good thing to seek out interesting results if they are there in the data? Shouldn’t we “let the data speak?” The answer is yes<label for="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">7</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">7</span> Note that exploratory research is not the same as p-hacking, which is explicitly dishonest because it involves deliberately withholding information.</span>! In fact, we have dedicated a whole chapter to exploratory data analysis (Chapter <a href="15-eda.html#eda">15</a>). The important thing to remember about exploratory research is that you need to (a) be aware of the increased risk of bias and calibrate your confidence in the results accordingly; (2) be honest with other researchers about your analysis strategy so they are also aware of the risk of bias and can calibrate <em>their</em> confidence in the results accordingly. Its important to understand the distinction between exploratory and confirmatory research modes<label for="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">8</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">8</span> In practice, an individual study may contain both exploratory and confirmatory aspects which is why we describe them as different ‘modes.’</span>. Confirmatory research involves making design and analysis decisions, <em>before</em> the results have been observed. In the next section, we will learn about how to do that using preregistration.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Reducing bias, increasing transparency, and calibrating confidence with preregistration</h2>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to counter the problem of undisclosed researcher degrees of freedom outlined above, is to make research decisions before seeing the study results - a bit like planning your route through the garden of forking paths before you start your journey. A great way to do this is preregistration <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hardwicke2021b" role="doc-biblioref">Tom E. Hardwicke &amp; Wagenmakers, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-wagenmakers2012" role="doc-biblioref">Wagenmakers et al., 2012</a>)</span>. Preregistration involves declaring your research decisions in an online public registry before the data are inspected. Preregistration ensures that your decisions are results-independent, which reduces risk of bias arising from the issues described above. Preregistration also transparently conveys to others what you planned, helping them to determine the risk of bias and calibrate their confidence in the results. In other words, preregistration transparently provides the context needed to properly evaluate and interpret research. In theory, preregistration dissuades researchers from engaging in questionable research practices like p-hacking and undisclosed HARKing, because they can be held accountable to their original plan.</p>
<p>Preregistration does not require that you specify all research decisions in advance, only that you are transparent about what was planned, and what was not planned. This helps to make a distinction between which aspects of the research were exploratory and which were confirmatory (Figure <a href="10-prereg.html#fig:continuum">10.6</a>). All else being equal, we should have more confidence in confirmatory findings, because there is a lower risk of bias. Exploratory analyses have a higher risk of bias, but they are also more sensitive to serendipitous (unexpected) discoveries. So exploratory and confirmatory research are both valuable activities, it is just important to differentiate them <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tukey1980" role="doc-biblioref">Tukey, 1980</a>)</span>. Preregistration offers the best of both worlds by clearing separating one from the other.</p>

<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 10.6: Preregistration clarifies where aspects of your research fall on a spectrum of exploratory and confirmatory modes of research.

<p>In addition to the benefits described above, preregistration may improve the quality of research by encouraging closer attention to study planning. We’ve found that it really helps facilitate communication between collaborators, and can catch addressable problems before time and resources are wasted on a poorly designed study. Detailed advanced planning can also create opportunities for useful community feedback, particularly in the context of Registered Reports, where dedicated peer reviewers will evaluate your study before its even begun (Box 2).</p>
<div class="interactive">
<p>Box 2. Preregistration and friends: A toolbox to address researcher degrees of freedom</p>
<p>There are several useful tools and concepts that can be used to complement or extend preregistration. In general, we would recommend that these are combined with preregistration, rather than used as a replacement, because preregistration provides transparency <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hardwicke2021b" role="doc-biblioref">Tom E. Hardwicke &amp; Wagenmakers, 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Robustness checks</strong>. Robustness checks (or ‘sensitivity analyses’) involve directly assessing how different decision choices in the garden of forking paths affect the results. This is particularly helpful when you ensure how to choose between several justifiable choices, neither of which seem superior to the other, or which have complementary strengths and weaknesses. For example, you might run the analysis three times using three different methods for handling missing data. Robust results would not vary substantially across the three different choices. Recently, some researchers have started running large-scale robustness checks (sometimes called “multiverse analysis” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-steegen2016" role="doc-biblioref">Steegen et al., 2016</a>)</span> or “specification curve” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-simonsohn2020" role="doc-biblioref">Simonsohn et al., 2020</a>)</span>), that evaluate the factorial intersection of multiple choices for multiple decisions - like simultaneously evaluating thousands of pathways in the garden of forking paths. Some have argued that these large-scale robustness checks can make preregistration redundant - after all, why prespecify a single path if you can explore them all? <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oberauer2019" role="doc-biblioref">Oberauer &amp; Lewandowsky, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-rubin2020" role="doc-biblioref">Rubin, 2020</a>)</span>. However, interpreting the results of a multiverse analysis are not straightforward; for example, it seems unlikely that all of the decision choices are equally justifiable <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-giudice2021" role="doc-biblioref">Giudice &amp; Gangestad, 2021</a>)</span>. Furthermore, if robustness checks are not preregistered, then they introduce researcher degrees of freedom, and create an opportunity for selective reporting, which increases risk of bias.</p>
<p><strong>Hold-out sample</strong>. One option to benefit from both exploratory and confirmatory research modes is to split your data into a ‘training’ and ‘hold-out’ sample. You can generate hypotheses in an exploratory mode in the training sample and use that as the basis to preregister confirmatory analyses in the hold-out sample. A notable disadvantage of this strategy is that splitting the data reduces statistical power.</p>
<p><strong>Masked analysis</strong> (traditionally called ‘blind analysis’). Sometimes problems, such as missing data, attrition, or randomization failure can arise during data collection that you did not anticipate in your preregistered plan. How do you diagnose and address these issues without increasing risk of bias through results-dependent analysis? One option is masked analysis, which disguises aspects of the data related to the results (for example, by shuffling condition labels or adding noise) whilst still allowing some degree of data inspection <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dutilh2019" role="doc-biblioref">Dutilh et al., 2019</a>)</span>. After diagnosing a problem, you can adjust your preregistered plan without increasing risk of bias, because you have not engaged in results-dependent decision making.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Operating Procedures</strong>. Community norms, perhaps at the level of your research field or lab, can act as a natural constraint on researcher degrees of freedom. For example, there may be a generally accepted approach for handling outliers in your community. You can make these constraints explicit by writing them down in a Standard Operating Procedures document - a bit like a living meta-preregistration <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lin2016" role="doc-biblioref">Lin &amp; Green, 2016</a>)</span>. Each time you preregister an individual study, you can co-register this document alongside it. Make sure you are clear about which document you will follow in the event of a mismatch!</p>
<p><strong>Open lab notebooks</strong>. Maintaining a lab notebook can be a useful way to keep a record of your decisions as a research project unfolds. Preregistration is bit like taking a snapshot of your lab notebook at the start of the project, when all you have written down is your research plan. Making your lab notebook publicly available is a great way to transparently document your research and departures from the preregistered plan.</p>
<p><strong>Registered Reports</strong>. Registered Reports are a type of article format that embeds preregistration directly into the publication pipeline [<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-chambers2020" role="doc-biblioref">Chambers &amp; Tzavella</a> (<a href="#ref-chambers2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>; Figure <a href="10-prereg.html#fig:reg-reports">10.7</a>]. The idea is that you submit your preregistered protocol to a journal and it is peer reviewed, before you’ve even started your study. If the study is approved, the journal agrees to publish it, regardless of the results. This is a radical departure from traditional publication models where peer reviewers and journals evaluate your study <em>after</em> its been completed and the results are known. Because the study is accepted for publication independently of the results, Registered Reports can offer the benefits of preregistration with additional protection against publication bias. Its also a great opportunity to feedback on your study design whilst you can still change it!</p>

<p>🔬 Case study: Undisclosed analytic flexibility in the wild</p>
<p>NB this box was previously called “A tale of two RCTs” but I’m not sure why - there’s only one RCT right?</p>
<p>A few years ago, one of us (Mike) was reading a paper <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-berkowitz2015" role="doc-biblioref">Berkowitz et al., 2015</a>)</span> and something seemed odd. The paper reported a randomized field experiment evaluating an educational app intended to increase children’s math skills. According to the reported analysis, the app was a success. But the analysis had not been preregistered, and Mike found some of the analysis choices to be unusual. For example, the analysis had probed whether there was an effect of the app in particular subgroups, but neglected to evaluate whether there was an overall effect. Mike was concerned that the results were affected by undisclosed analytic flexibility and published a commentary consisting of alternative analyses that suggested the app was not effective <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-frank2016" role="doc-biblioref">Frank, 2016</a>)</span>. The original authors responded that their analyses were entirely based on prior research and argued that the disagreement about how the data should be analyzed was “philosophical” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-berkowitz2016" role="doc-biblioref">Berkowitz et al., 2016</a>)</span>. The problem here is that it is very difficult to know the extent to which the original analysis was influenced by the results. If the analysis plan had been preregistered, this would reduce the risk of bias and allow Mike and other readers to have more confidence in the reported results<label for="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">9</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">9</span> Its worth pointing out that preregistration cannot magically improve a poorly specified analysis. One aspect of the original analysis was straightforwardly erroneous (though the original authors dispute this) because it concluded that there was an effect in one group, but not in another, by testing the effect separately in those groups, and neglecting to test the interaction. This is a statistical fallacy, regardless of whether the analyses were preregistered <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gelman2006" role="doc-biblioref">Gelman &amp; Hill, 2006</a>)</span>. Nevertheless, preregistration would have provided transparency to enable a more informed scientific debate about the results without concern for whether they influenced by undisclosed analytic flexibility.</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> How to preregister</h2>
<p>Preregistration is actually pretty new to psychology, and there’s still no standard way of doing it - you’re already at the cutting edge<label for="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">10</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">10</span> There’s a much longer history of registering research in medicine <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dickersin2012" role="doc-biblioref">Dickersin &amp; Rennie, 2012</a>)</span> and preregistration has only recently started to gain traction in other disciplines like psychology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nosek2018" role="doc-biblioref">Nosek et al., 2018</a>)</span>. Its still very rare though; one study estimated that about 3% of psychology studies are preregistered <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hardwicke2021c" role="doc-biblioref">Tom E. Hardwicke et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</span>! We recommend using the Open Science Framework (OSF) as this is one of the most popular registries in psychology and you can do lots of other useful things there to make your research transparent, like sharing data, materials, analysis scripts, and preprints. On the OSF it is possible to “register” any file you have uploaded. When you register a file, it creates a timestamped, read-only copy, with a dedicated link. You can add this link to articles reporting your research. One approach to preregistration is to write a protocol document that specifies the study rationale, aims or hypotheses, methods, and analysis plan, and register that.<label for="tufte-sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">11</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-11" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">11</span> You can think of a study protocol a bit like a research paper without a results and discussion section (here’s an example from one of our own studies: <a href="https://osf.io/2cnkq/" class="uri">https://osf.io/2cnkq/</a>).</span> The OSF also has a collection of dedicated preregistration templates that you can use if you prefer. These templates are often tailored to the needs of particular types of research. For example, there are templates for general quantitative psychology research <span class="citation">(<span>“PRP-QUANT”</span> <a href="#ref-bosnjak2021" role="doc-biblioref">Bosnjak et al., 2021</a>)</span>, cognitive modelling <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cruwell2021" role="doc-biblioref">Crüwell &amp; Evans, 2021</a>)</span>, and secondary data analysis <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-akker2019" role="doc-biblioref">Akker et al., 2019</a>)</span>. The OSF interface may change, but currently if you go to <a href="https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738834-Create-a-Preregistration" class="uri">https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738834-Create-a-Preregistration</a> you can follow the steps to create a preregistration.</p>
<p>Once you’ve preregistered your plan, you just go off and run the study and report the results, right? Well hopefully…but things might not turn out to be that straightforward. Its quite common to forgot to include something in your plan or to have to depart from the plan due to something unexpected. Preregistration can actually be pretty hard in practice <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nosek2019" role="doc-biblioref">Nosek et al., 2019</a>)</span>! Don’t worry though - remember that the primary goal of preregistration is transparency to enable others to evaluate and interpret our work. If you decide to depart from your original plan and conduct results-dependent analyses, then this may increase the risk of bias. But its important to know that so we can appropriately calibrate our confidence in the results. You may even be able to run both the planned and unplanned analyses as a robustness check (Box 2) to evaluate the extent to which this choice impacts the results.</p>
<p>When you report your study, it is important to distinguish between what was planned and what was not. If you ran a lot of results-dependent analyses, then it might be worth having separate exploratory and confirmatory results sections. If you mainly stuck to your original plan, with only minor departures, then you could include a table (perhaps in an appendix) that outlines these changes (for example, see Supplementary Information A of this article: <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/wt5ny" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/wt5ny</a>)</p>
