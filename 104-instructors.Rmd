# Instructor's Guide {#instructors}


## Introduction 

This is an instructor’s guide to conducting replication projects in courses. 

Possible motivations for structuring a course around replication projects include: 

* **Student interest**: Allows application of course methods and lessons to a topic that is interesting to each student.
* **Usefulness**: If this course is taught in the first year of the program (as recommended), students may use their project as a way to establish. robustness of a phenomenon before building studies on top of it
* **Realism**: Real data is often messier than practice datasets typically provided for course exercises.
* **Intuition**: Final presentation of students’ replication outcomes trains students to read the literature with a better “sense” of which studies may be more likely to replicate than others. Frustrating experiences can motivate students to adopt best practices for their own future studies.
* **Logistics**: we provide some discussion of course budgets as well as sample text for course-related Institutional Review Board applications and a sample syllabus for a 10-week and 16-week version of the course. 

## Scenarios for different course layouts

First, before we dive in, we want to acknowledge that a project-based course may look very different depending on student level (undergraduate vs. graduate/post-doc level) and availability of resources at your institution for a course like this, namely in terms of TA support and course funding (for data collection). Since these considerations will likely shape some important decisions you make in designing your course, we'll address these factors here:

### Student Level:

While Psych 251 at Stanford is geared towards graduate students (and is currently a required class for entering first-year graduate students in the Psychology Department), we also accept advanced undergraduate students as well as graduate students from other departments (e.g., Education, Human-Computer Interaction, Philosophy, Computer Science). On the first day of our course, we tell students that they should be comfortable with two fo the three following topics:

1) Some knowledge of psychological experimentation & subject matter

2) Statistical programming: things like functions and variables

3) Basic statistics like ANOVA and t-test

If students are only comfortable with one of the three topics above, we warn them ahead of time that the course may demand more time from them than the average student. 

Now, if you are planning on catering this course for undergraduate students, chances are tehy have had less exposure to these toipcs overall, so there are multiple ways to calibrate the course accordingly:

1) **Prerequisites**: Require students to have completed courses that cover at least two of the three topics mentioned above (i.e., a psychology class, a class that covers statistical programming, a class that covers basic statistics, any two of the three).

2) **Pace**: unlike Psych 251, where the entire course only lasts 10 weeks, a class for undergraduates may benefit from a slower pace, allowing more time to cover the foundational principles before diving into the project. For instance, the course could be held over multiple academic semesters/quarters, with the project goal of Course #1 being choosing and planning the replication study, and the project goal of Course #2 being the execution and interpretation of the replication. 

3) **Pair-Group-Based Projects**: In Psych 251, each student is required to conduct their own replication project. However, this structure may be overwhelming for undergraduate students who may have less confidence taking on an entire replication project by themselves. One option that may alleviate this pressure is to have students conduct these projects as pairs or as small teams, so that they can collectively draw on each others' strengths. When assigning these pairs or teams, it may be especially helpful to try to ensure a relatively even balance of students who are confident in each of the three areas outlined above (psychology, statistical programming, basic statistics). 

Now that we've offered a few suggestions to address different student levels, let's dive into the issue of course resources.


### Course Resources:

We think there are two main ways in which your course may have different resources from our model: In terms of course assistance (i.e., teaching assistants), and in terms of course funding for student projects. We'll explore ways to work around each of these in this section:

#### Teaching Assistants (or the lack thereof)

As a point of comparison, in general, 2-3 teaching assistants are allocated to Psych 251, which enrolls about 36 students, which comes out to about 12-18 students per TA. Since a project-based course requires individual attention and feedback, we would recommend against a student-TA ratio that is much higher than that. That means that if you know you will have just one TA for the class, you should think about reducing the enrollment cap accordingly. But what if you have *no* TAs? With some adjustments, there are still awys you can make the course work sans-TA; we outline a few ideas below:

1) **Peer grading**: As an instructor with no TAs, the area that will require the biggest lift in temrs of time and attention is grading. One way to overcome this is to introduce a peer-grading system, in which students grade each others' work. If you choose this route, two things that may encourage fair grading among your students is to 1) distribute a clear and specific rubric that reduces the amount of subjectivity in the grading process as much as possible, and 2) anonymize the assignments so that students do not know whose assignment they are grading. If possible, it may again be beneficial to assign grading pairs that consist of students that are relatively knowledgeable in different areas, so that they can provide feedback that address weak points in each others' work. 

2) **Collective troubleshooting**: The second most time intensive area you will have to make up for is the amount of troubleshooting you may have to do for students who run into issues implement their projects, anywhere from getting GitHub and RMarkdown up and running on their devices, to trouble with data collection on Mechanical Turk. One way to encourage communal support among your students is to set up a central discussion board for the course (e.g., Piazza) where students can publicly (but anonymously, if desired) post issues they are running into. Then, you can offer extra credit to students who help troubleshoot these issues, in order to further incentivize collective troubleshooting. There will likely still be issues that cannot be addressed by the students, but this system at least frees up your time to focus your attention on those that only *you* can address.

3) **Single class-wide project**: Finally, if the collective grading and troubleshooting methods outlined above do not cut down on enough time, you could consider walking through a single replication project as a class. ^[We should mention up front that this approach does cancel out some of the benefits of a project-based course we mentioned at the start - namely, the project will likely no longer fit each student's specific research interest, so there may be less benefit in terms of specific student interest and usefulness for their program of research, but the other two benefits of realism and intuition (especially if the project is discussed in the context of other replication findings) still stand.] To make a single-project course work, you could have students nominate studies they would like to replicate as a class, and then have them vote no the final choice. Once the target study has been selected, every student can individually carry out all the steps of the project, including preregistering and writing up the analysis script. Then, setting up and running the data collection phase can happen during class, and once data has been collected, you can distribute it to the students for them to run it through their analysis script and interpret the result. Whether you choose to have students grade each others' work or whether you garde their work youself, the fact that the project is standardized should cut down on a lot of the time you would otherwise spend learning about the details of every individual project.






## Student Assignments

### Problem Set 0: Git and Github

* Points: 5 points
* Instructions: "Submit a link to the Github repository you created. In order to receive credit, the repository must have an appropriately-formatted README file and another file with one successfully-pushed change in its history. This shows you have pushed a change in a second file to GitHub"
