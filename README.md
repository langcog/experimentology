### Michael C. Frank, Mika Braginsky, Julie Cachia, Nicholas Coles, Tom Hardwicke, Robert Hawkins, Maya Mathur, and Rondeline Williams

A new open access textbook on experimental methods to be published by MIT Press. 

Available here: http://experimentology.io

Book manuscript is not final and text is expected to change (mostly in minor ways) through at least early 2024. 

To build locally (this is uncommon):
* Make sure Quarto is up to date (we use HomeBrew)
* Restore dependencies using `renv::restore()`
