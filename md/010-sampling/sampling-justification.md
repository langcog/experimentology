| Background                  | We did not have strong prior information about the likely effect size, so we could not compute a classical power analysis.                                                    |
| Smallest effect of interest | Because of our interest in meaningful factors affecting word learning, we were interested in effect sizes as small as $d=0.5$.                                                   |
| Resource limitation         | We were also limited by our ability to collect data only at our on-campus preschool.                                                                                          |
| Power computation           | We calculated that based on our maximal possible sample size of $N = 120$ (60 per group), we would achieve at least 80% power to reject the null for effects as small as $d = 0.52$. |
