| Power analysis                   | Stop at $N$ for known probability of rejecting the null given known effect size                       | Randomized trial with strong expectations about effect size                  |
| Resource constraint              | Stop collecting data after a certain amount of time or after a certain amount of resources are used | Time-limited field work                                                      |
| Smallest effect size of interest | Stop at $N$ for known probability of rejecting the null for effects greater than some minimum         | Measurement of a theoretically important effect with unknown magnitude       |
| Precision analysis               | Stop at $N$ that provides some known degree of precision in measure                                   | Experimental measurement to compare with predictions of cognitive models     |
| Sequential analysis              | Stop when a known inferential criterion is reached                                                  | Intervention trial designed to accept or reject null with maximal efficiency |
