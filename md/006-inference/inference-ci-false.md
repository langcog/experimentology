| 1 | "The probability that the true mean is greater than $0$ is at least 95%." |
| 2 | "The probability that the true mean equals $0$ is smaller than 5%." |
| 3 | "The 'null hypothesis' that the true mean equals $0$ is likely to be incorrect." |
| 4 | "There is a 95% probability that the true mean lies between $0.1$ and $0.4$." |
| 5 | "We can be 95% confident that the true mean lies between $0.1$ and $0.4$." |
| 6 | "If we were to repeat the experiment over and over, then 95% of the time the true mean falls between $0.1$ and $0.4$." |
