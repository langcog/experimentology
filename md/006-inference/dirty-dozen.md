|  1 | "If $p = 0.05$, the null hypothesis has only a 5% chance of being true."                                                                      |
|  2 | "A nonsignificant difference (e.g., $p \geq 0.05$) means there is no difference between groups."                                              |
|  3 | "A statistically significant finding is clinically important."                                                                               |
|  4 | "Studies with $p$-values on opposite sides of $0.05$ are conflicting."                                                                          |
|  5 | "Studies with the same $p$-value provide the same evidence against the null hypothesis."                                                     |
|  6 | "$p = 0.05$ means that we have observed data that would occur only 5% of the time under the null hypothesis."                                 |
|  7 | "$p = 0.05$ and $p \leq 0.05$ mean the same thing."                                                                                            |
|  8 | "$p$-values are properly written as inequalities (e.g., '$p \leq 0.02$' when $p = 0.015$)."                                                     |
|  9 | "$p = 0.05$ means that if you reject the null hypothesis, the probability of a false positive error is only 5%."                              |
| 10 | "With a $p = 0.05$ threshold for significance, the chance of a false positive error will be 5%."                                              |
| 11 | "You should use a one-sided $p$-value when you don't care about a result in one direction, or a difference in that direction is impossible." |
| 12 | "A scientific conclusion or treatment policy should be based on whether or not the $p$-value is significant."                                |
