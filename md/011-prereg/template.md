| 1 | Data collection. Have any data been collected for this study already?                                                                                                                 |   |   |
| 2 | Hypothesis. What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study?                                                                                            |   |   |
| 3 | Dependent variable. Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured.                                                                                      |   |   |
| 4 | Conditions. Which conditions will participants be assigned to?                                                                                                           |   |   |
| 5 | Analyses. Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.                                                                                     |   |   |
| 6 | Outliers and Exclusions. Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding observations.                                              |   |   |
| 7 | Sample Size. How many observations will be collected, or what will determine sample size? No need to justify decision, but be precise about exactly how the number will be determined. |   |   |
| 8 | Other. Anything else you would like to preregister (e.g., secondary analyses, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned).                               |   |   |
