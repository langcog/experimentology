We examined the rise of this definition in psychology and other disciplines by comparing 236 introductory texts from psychology, sociology, biology, and physics published during the 1930s, 1950s, and 1970s. The definition of experiment in psychology texts did not approach uniformity until the 1970s and was not borrowed from texts of other disciplines. The standard definition is relatively absent from physics, infrequent in biology, and appears in sociology after its development in psychology. We discuss the enshrinement of experimentation as the sole method for the discovery of causes.},

	abstract = {Newborn babies look preferentially at faces and face-like
              displays, yet over the course of their first year much changes
              about both the way infants process visual stimuli and how they
              allocate their attention to the social world. Despite this
              initial preference for faces in restricted contexts, the amount
              that infants look at faces increases considerably during the
              first year. Is this development related to changes in attentional
              orienting abilities? We explored this possibility by showing 3-,
              6-, and 9-month-olds engaging animated and live-action videos of
              social stimuli and also measuring their visual search performance
              with both moving and static search displays. Replicating previous
              findings, looking at faces increased with age; in addition, the
              amount of looking at faces was strongly related to the youngest
              infants' performance in visual search. These results suggest that
              infants' attentional abilities may be an important factor in
              facilitating their social attention early in development.},

              semester variation in 10 known effects, 10 individual
              differences, and 3 data quality indicators over the course of the
              academic semester in 20 participant pools (N=2696) and with an

              individual differences---conscientiousness, mood, and stress.
              However, there was little evidence for time of semester
              qualifying experimental or correlational effects. The generality
              of this evidence is unknown because only a subset of the tested

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the theoretical, pragmatic, and substantive
               factors that have hampered the integration between psychology
               and psychometrics. Theoretical factors include the
               operationalist mode of thinking which is common throughout
               psychology, the dominance of classical test theory, and the use
               of ``construct validity'' as a catch-all category for a range of
               challenging psychometric problems. Pragmatic factors include the
               lack of interest in mathematically precise thinking in
               psychology, inadequate representation of psychometric modeling
               in major statistics programs, and insufficient mathematical

               tea poured into milk tastes differently than that of milk poured
               into tea. Her notion is shouted down by the scientific minds of
               the group. But one guest, by the name Ronald Aylmer Fisher,
               proposes to scientifically test the lady's hypothesis. There was
               no better person to conduct such a test. For Fisher had brought
               to the field of statistics an emphasis on controlling the
               methods for obtaining data and the importance of interpretation.
               He knew that how the data was gathered and applied was as
               important as the data themselves.In The Lady Tasting Tea,
               readers will encounter not only Ronald Fisher's theories (and
               their repercussions), but the ideas of dozens of men and women
               whose revolutionary work affects our everyday lives. Writing
               with verve and wit, author David Salsburg traces the rise and
               fall of Karl Pearson's theories, explores W. Edwards Deming's
               statistical methods of quality control (which rebuilt postwar

               early work on the capacity of small beer casks at the Guinness
               brewing factory. The Lady Tasting Tea is not a book of dry facts

	abstract = {We analyzed one decade of data collected by the Programme for
              International Student Assessment (PISA), including the
              mathematics and reading performance of nearly 1.5 million 15 year
              olds in 75 countries. Across nations, boys scored higher than
              girls in mathematics, but lower than girls in reading. The sex
              difference in reading was three times as large as in mathematics.
              There was considerable variation in the extent of the sex
              differences between nations. There are countries without a sex
              difference in mathematics performance, and in some countries
              girls scored higher than boys. Boys scored lower in reading in
              all nations in all four PISA assessments (2000, 2003, 2006,
              2009). Contrary to several previous studies, we found no evidence
              that the sex differences were related to nations' gender equality
              indicators. Further, paradoxically, sex differences in
              mathematics were consistently and strongly inversely correlated
              with sex differences in reading: Countries with a smaller sex
              difference in mathematics had a larger sex difference in reading
              and vice versa. We demonstrate that this was not merely a
              between-nation, but also a within-nation effect. This effect is
              related to relative changes in these sex differences across the
              performance continuum: We did not find a sex difference in
              mathematics among the lowest performing students, but this is
              where the sex difference in reading was largest. In contrast, the
              sex difference in mathematics was largest among the higher
              performing students, and this is where the sex difference in
              reading was smallest. The implication is that if policy makers
              decide that changes in these sex differences are desired,
              different approaches will be needed to achieve this for reading
              and mathematics. Interventions that focus on high-achieving girls
              in mathematics and on low achieving boys in reading are likely to
              yield the strongest educational benefits.},

              requirements to ensure research integrity. These include
              prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of
              selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices,
              complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in
              response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of

              candidates. To select a candidate efficiently in these cases, we

              research based on the *replication value* of the set of claims

	abstract = {Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is an online crowdsourcing service
              where anonymous online workers complete web-based tasks for small
              sums of money. The service has attracted attention from
              experimental psychologists interested in gathering human subject
              data more efficiently. However, relative to traditional
              laboratory studies, many aspects of the testing environment are
              not under the experimenter's control. In this paper, we attempt
              to empirically evaluate the fidelity of the AMT system for use in
              cognitive behavioral experiments. These types of experiment
              differ from simple surveys in that they require multiple trials,
              sustained attention from participants, comprehension of complex
              instructions, and millisecond accuracy for response recording and
              stimulus presentation. We replicate a diverse body of tasks from
              experimental psychology including the Stroop, Switching, Flanker,
              Simon, Posner Cuing, attentional blink, subliminal priming, and
              category learning tasks using participants recruited using AMT.
              While most of replications were qualitatively successful and
              validated the approach of collecting data anonymously online
              using a web-browser, others revealed disparity between laboratory
              results and online results. A number of important lessons were
              encountered in the process of conducting these replications that
              should be of value to other researchers.},

	abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature,
              yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential
              statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative
              to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical
              expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned-that is, that
              the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical
              observations. Here I argue that many applications of statistical
              inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition.
              Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology-the
              linear mixed model-I explore the consequences of failing to
              statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that
              respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I
              demonstrate that whereas the ``random effect'' formalism is used
              pervasively in psychology to model inter-subject variability, few
              researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they
              clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or
              research sites). The under-specification of random effects
              imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of
              results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these
              constraints can dramatically inflate false positive rates, and
              often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations
              that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities
              they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the
              alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously
              lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g.,
              the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of
              several potential avenues for improvement.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The expansion of evidence-based
               practice across sectors has lead to an increasing variety of
               review types. However, the diversity of terminology used means
               that the full potential of these review types may be lost
               amongst a confusion of indistinct and misapplied terms. The
               objective of this study is to provide descriptive insight into
               the most common types of reviews, with illustrative examples
               from health and health information domains. METHODS: Following
               scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary
               associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary
               warrant). A simple analytical framework -- Search, AppraisaL,
               Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA) -- was used to examine the main
               review types. RESULTS: Fourteen review types and associated
               methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework,
               illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A
               description of the key characteristics is given, together with
               perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review
               types are currently utilized within the health information
               domain. CONCLUSIONS: Few review types possess prescribed and
               explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually
               exclusive. Notwithstanding such limitations, this typology
               provides a valuable reference point for those commissioning,
               conducting, supporting or interpreting reviews, both within
               health information and the wider health care domain.},

              counseling, social, personality, school, and community) lack the
              cumulative character of scientific knowledge because they tend
              neither to be refuted nor corroborated, but instead merely fade
              away as people lose interest. Even though intrinsic subject
              matter difficulties (20 are listed) contribute to this, the
              excessive reliance on significance testing is partly responsible
              (Ronald A. Fisher). Karl Popper's approach, with modifications,
              would be prophylactic. Since the null hypothesis is quasi-always
              false, tables summarizing research in terms of patterns of
              ``significant differences'' are little more than complex,
              causally uninterpretable outcomes of statistical power functions.
              Multiple paths to estimating numerical point values
              (``consistency tests'') are better, even if approximate with
              rough tolerances; and lacking this, ranges, orderings, 2nd-order
              differences, curve peaks and valleys, and function forms should
              be used. Such methods are usual in developed sciences that seldom

               uninformative (e.g., using arbitrary standards) or misleading
               (e.g., squaring effect-size rs). We propose that effect sizes
               can be usefully evaluated by comparing them with well-understood
               benchmarks or by considering them in terms of concrete
               consequences. In that light, we conclude that when reliably
               estimated (a critical consideration), an effect-size r of .05
               indicates an effect that is very small for the explanation of
               single events but potentially consequential in the not-very-long
               run, an effect-size r of .10 indicates an effect that is still
               small at the level of single events but potentially more
               ultimately consequential, an effect-size r of .20 indicates a
               medium effect that is of some explanatory and practical use even
               in the short run and therefore even more important, and an
               effect-size r of .30 indicates a large effect that is
               potentially powerful in both the short and the long run. A very
               large effect size (r = .40 or greater) in the context of
               psychological research is likely to be a gross overestimate that
               will rarely be found in a large sample or in a replication. Our

               through to the factors that produced the burst of modern
               statistical innovation in the early twentieth century. Theodore

               the field came into being through the efforts of social
               scientists, who saw a need for statistical tools in their
               examination of society. Pioneering statistical physicists and

               the past century, with wider awareness following Tukey's
               Exploratory Data Analysis and Tufte's books in the succeeding
               decades. But statistical graphics still occupy an awkward
               in-between position: within statistics, exploratory and
               graphical methods represent a minor subfield and are not well
               integrated with larger themes of modeling and inference. Outside
               of statistics, infographics (also called information
               visualization or Infovis) are huge, but their purveyors and
               enthusiasts appear largely to be uninterested in statistical
               principles.We present here a set of goals for graphical displays
               discussed primarily from the statistical point of view and
               discuss some inherent contradictions in these goals that may be
               impeding communication between the fields of statistics and
               Infovis. One of our constructive suggestions, to Infovis
               practitioners and statisticians alike, is to try not to cram
               into a single graph what can be better displayed in two or more.
               We recognize that we offer only one perspective and intend this
               article to be a starting point for a wide-ranging discussion
               among graphic designers, statisticians, and users of statistical
               methods. The purpose of this article is not to criticize but to
               explore the different goals that lead researchers in different

              widespread replication study design, each of several
              collaborating sites (such as universities) independently tries to
              replicate an original study, and the results are synthesized
              across sites. Hedges and Schauer (2019) proposed statistical
              analyses for these replication projects; their analyses focus on
              assessing the extent to which results differ across the
              replication sites, by testing for heterogeneity among a set of
              replication studies, while excluding the original study. We agree
              with their premises regarding the limitations of existing
              analysis methods and regarding the importance of accounting for
              heterogeneity among the replications. This objective may be
              interesting in its own right. However, we argue that by focusing
              only on whether the replication studies have similar effect sizes

              for assessing whether the replications in fact support the

              of multisite replication projects. We reanalyze Hedges and
              Schauer's (2019) example dataset using alternative metrics of
              replication success that directly address these objectives. We
              reach a more optimistic conclusion regarding replication success

	abstract = {Summary Increasingly, researchers are attempting to replicate
               published original studies by using large, multisite replication
               projects, at least 134 of which have been completed or are on
               going. These designs are promising to assess whether the
               original study is statistically consistent with the replications
               and to reassess the strength of evidence for the scientific
               effect of interest. However, existing analyses generally focus
               on single replications; when applied to multisite designs, they
               provide an incomplete view of aggregate evidence and can lead to
               misleading conclusions about replication success. We propose new
               statistical metrics representing firstly the probability that
               the original study's point estimate would be at least as extreme
               as it actually was, if in fact the original study were
               statistically consistent with the replications, and secondly the
               estimated proportion of population effects agreeing in direction
               with the original study. Generalized versions of the second
               metric enable consideration of only meaningfully strong
               population effects that agree in direction, or alternatively
               that disagree in direction, with the original study. These
               metrics apply when there are at least 10 replications (unless
               the heterogeneity estimate $\tau$^=0, in which case the metrics
               apply regardless of the number of replications). The first
               metric assumes normal population effects but appears robust to
               violations in simulations; the second is distribution free. We
               provide R packages (Replicate and MetaUtility).},

	abstract = {Unplanned optional stopping rules have been criticized for
              inflating Type I error rates under the null hypothesis
              significance testing (NHST) paradigm. Despite these criticisms,
              this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it
              appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an
              indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution,
              we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian
              hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited
              multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure,
              which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are
              computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached.
              This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon
              correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We
              investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the
              average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size
              estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean
              differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF
              design typically needs 50\% to 70\% smaller samples to reach a
              conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same
              or lower long-term rate of wrong inference. (PsycINFO Database

              p-values reported in eight major psychology journals from 1985
              until 2013, using the new R package ``statcheck.'' statcheck
              retrieved null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) results
              from over half of the articles from this period. In line with
              earlier research, we found that half of all published psychology
              papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was
              inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One
              in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may
              have affected the statistical conclusion. In contrast to earlier
              findings, we found that the average prevalence of inconsistent
              p-values has been stable over the years or has declined. The
              prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values
              reported as significant than in p-values reported as
              nonsignificant. This could indicate a systematic bias in favor of
              significant results. Possible solutions for the high prevalence
              of reporting inconsistencies could be to encourage sharing data,
              to let co-authors check results in a so-called ``co-pilot
              model,'' and to use statcheck to flag possible inconsistencies in
              one's own manuscript or during the review process.},

              consciousness is necessary for abstract, symbolic, and
              rule-following computations. Hence, semantic processing of
              multiple-word expressions, and performing of abstract
              mathematical computations, are widely believed to require
              consciousness. We report a series of experiments in which we show
              that multiple-word verbal expressions can be processed outside
              conscious awareness and that multistep, effortful arithmetic
              equations can be solved unconsciously. All experiments used
              Continuous Flash Suppression to render stimuli invisible for
              relatively long durations (up to 2,000 ms). Where appropriate,
              unawareness was verified using both objective and subjective
              measures. The results show that novel word combinations, in the
              form of expressions that contain semantic violations, become
              conscious before expressions that do not contain semantic
              violations, that the more negative a verbal expression is, the
              more quickly it becomes conscious, and that subliminal arithmetic
              equations prime their results. These findings call for a
              significant update of our view of conscious and unconscious

	abstract = {A recent study claimed to have obtained evidence that
              participants can solve invisible multistep arithmetic equations
              (Sklar et al., 2012). The authors used a priming paradigm in
              which reaction times to targets congruent with the equation's
              solution were responded to faster compared with incongruent ones.
              We critically reanalyzed the data set of Sklar et al. and show
              that the claims being made in the article are not fully supported
              by the alternative analyses that we applied. A Bayesian
              reanalysis of the data accounting for the random variability of
              the target stimuli in addition to the subjects shows that the
              evidence for priming effects is less strong than initially
              claimed. That is, although Bayes factors revealed evidence for
              the presence of a priming effect, it was generally weak. Second,
              the claim that unconscious arithmetic occurs for subtraction but
              not for addition is not supported when the critical interaction
              is tested. Third, the data do not show well-established features
              of numerosity priming as derived from V-shaped response time
              curves for prime-target distances. Fourth, we show that it is
              impossible to classify reaction times as resulting from congruent
              or incongruent prime-target relationships, which should be
              expected if their results imply that participants genuinely solve
              the equations on each trial. We conclude that the claims being
              made in the original article are not fully supported by the
              analyses that we apply. Together with a recent failure to
              replicate the original results and a critique of the analysis
              based on regression to the mean, we argue that the current
              evidence for unconscious arithmetic is inconclusive. We argue
              that strong claims require strong evidence and stress that
              cumulative research strategies are needed to provide such
              evidence.},

              samples, or may otherwise be limited to specific, ungeneralizable
              settings or populations. Crowdsourced research, a type of
              large-scale collaboration in which one or more research projects
              are conducted across multiple lab sites, offers a pragmatic
              solution to these and other current methodological challenges.
              The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is a distributed
              network of laboratories designed to enable and support
              crowdsourced research projects. These projects can focus on novel
              research questions, or attempt to replicate prior research, in
              large, diverse samples. The PSA's mission is to accelerate the
              accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in
              psychological science. Here, we describe the background,
              structure, principles, procedures, benefits, and challenges of
              the PSA. In contrast to other crowdsourced research networks, the

	abstract = {Is consciousness required for high level cognitive processes, or
              can the unconscious mind perform tasks that are as complex and
              difficult as, for example, understanding a sentence? Recent work
              has argued that, yes, the unconscious mind can: Sklar et al.
              (2012) found that sentences, masked from consciousness using the
              technique of continuous flash suppression (CFS), broke into
              awareness more rapidly when their meanings were more unusual or
              more emotionally negative, even though processing the sentences'
              meaning required unconsciously combining each word's meaning.
              This has motivated the important claim that consciousness plays
              little-to-no functional role in high-level cognitive operations.
              Here, we aimed to replicate and extend these findings, but
              instead, across 10 high-powered studies, we found no evidence
              that the meaning of a phrase or word could be understood without
              awareness. We did, however, consistently find evidence that
              low-level perceptual features, such as sentence length and
              familiarity of alphabet, could be processed unconsciously. Our
              null findings for sentence processing are corroborated by a
              meta-analysis that aggregates our studies with the prior
              literature. We offer a potential explanation for prior positive
              results through a set of computational simulations, which show
              how the distributional characteristics of this type of CFS data,
              in particular its skew and heavy tail, can cause an elevated
              level of false positive results when common data exclusion
              criteria are applied. Our findings thus have practical
              implication for analyzing such data. More importantly, they
              suggest that consciousness may well be required for high-level
              cognitive tasks such as understanding language. (PsycINFO

              Sumby \& Pollack in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of
              America, 26(2), 212-215, 1954). One way that the visual signal
              facilitates speech recognition is by providing the listener with
              information about fine phonetic detail that complements
              information from the auditory signal. However, given that
              degraded face stimuli can still improve speech recognition
              accuracy (Munhall et al. in Perception \& Psychophysics, 66(4),
              574-583, 2004), and static or moving shapes can improve speech
              detection accuracy (Bernstein et al. in Speech Communication,
              44(1/4), 5-18, 2004), aspects of the visual signal other than
              fine phonetic detail may also contribute to the perception of
              speech. In two experiments, we show that a modulating circle
              providing information about the onset, offset, and acoustic
              amplitude envelope of the speech does not improve recognition of
              spoken sentences (Experiment 1) or words (Experiment 2), but does
              reduce the effort necessary to recognize speech. These results
              suggest that although fine phonetic detail may be required for
              the visual signal to benefit speech recognition, low-level
              features of the visual signal may function to reduce the

@article{spencer2011,
	abstract = {A major debate in the study of word learning centers on the
              extension of categories to new items. The rational approach
              assumes that learners make structured inferences about category
              membership, whereas the mechanistic approach emphasizes the
              attentional and memory processes that form the basis of
              generalization behaviors. Recent support for the rational view
              comes from observations of the suspicious-coincidence effect:
              People generalize category membership narrowly when presented
              with three subordinate-level exemplars that share the same label
              and generalize category membership broadly when presented with
              one exemplar. Across three experiments, we examined the
              mechanistic basis of this effect. Results showed that the
              presentation of multiple subordinate-level exemplars led to
              narrow generalization only when the exemplars were presented
              simultaneously, even when the number of exemplars was increased
              from three to six. These data demonstrate that the
              suspicious-coincidence effect is firmly grounded in the general
              cognitive processes of attention, memory, and visual comparison.},

	abstract = {Researchers have proposed that blocking facial feedback via
               glabellar-region botulinum toxin injections (GBTX) can reduce
               depression. Random-effects meta-analyses of studies that
               administered GBTX to individuals with depression indicate that,
               6 weeks postintervention, GBTX groups were significantly less
               depressed compared to placebo groups (d = 0.83) and pretreatment
               levels (d = 1.57). However, we noted the following concerns: (a)
               effect sizes were extraordinarily large, (b) authors failed to
               provide information to compute 51\% of relevant effect sizes,
               (c) 96\% of effect sizes came from studies conducted by
               investigators with conflicts of interest, (d) there is some
               evidence of publication bias, and (e) studies used ineffective
               blinding procedures. These considerations suggest that
               confidence in GBTX as a treatment for depression is premature.},

	abstract = {While rich medical, behavioral, and socio-demographic data are
              key to modern data-driven research, their collection and use
              raise legitimate privacy concerns. Anonymizing datasets through
              de-identification and sampling before sharing them has been the
              main tool used to address those concerns. We here propose a
              generative copula-based method that can accurately estimate the
              likelihood of a specific person to be correctly re-identified,
              even in a heavily incomplete dataset. On 210 populations, our
              method obtains AUC scores for predicting individual uniqueness
              ranging from 0.84 to 0.97, with low false-discovery rate. Using
              our model, we find that 99.98\% of Americans would be correctly
              re-identified in any dataset using 15 demographic attributes. Our
              results suggest that even heavily sampled anonymized datasets are
              unlikely to satisfy the modern standards for anonymization set
              forth by GDPR and seriously challenge the technical and legal
              adequacy of the de-identification release-and-forget model.},

              examining replications of three well-known findings. Its benefits

              replication attempts (i.e., studies yielding p > .05) that are
              too noisy from those that actively indicate the effect is

               that taboo is dead. The causal revolution, instigated by Judea
               Pearl and his colleagues, has cut through a century of confusion
               and established causality -- the study of cause and effect -- on
               a firm scientific basis. His work explains how we can know easy
               things, like whether it was rain or a sprinkler that made a
               sidewalk wet; and how to answer hard questions, like whether a
